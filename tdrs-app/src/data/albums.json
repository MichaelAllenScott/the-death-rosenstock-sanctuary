    "description": "\"Album Minus Band\" by Bomb the Music Industry! is a groundbreaking release that emerged in 2004, representing a bold departure from conventional album production. Led by the creative force of Jeff Rosenstock, the album was recorded entirely in isolation, with Rosenstock playing every instrument himself. This DIY approach not only demonstrated his multi-instrumental prowess but also embodied the band's commitment to challenging industry norms. The result is a raw and intimate collection of songs that captures the essence of punk and indie rock, with lyrics reflecting themes of introspection, frustration, and the human experience. \"Album Minus Band\" stands as a testament to Bomb the Music Industry!'s ethos of creative freedom, setting the stage for their influential role in shaping the landscape of independent and alternative music.",
    "explanation": "The grand scheme of this whole thing happened as it was being written/recorded. I realized that a lot of ideas that I have never happen because I can't think of a good way to write them down. Then after I DO write them down, I don't remember EXACTLY how I thought they should go so I can give them to the other people I'm in a band with. When The Arrogant Sons of Bitches went on hiatus, I no longer had a band. For a while this made me think \"well, I have no reason to write music 'cause who's gonna play it.\" After giving up for a couple of months, I started working on a few cover songs including Harvey Danger's \"Pike St. - Park Slope.\" It was a lot of fun to take someone else's ideas and try and make them my own, and since those songs were already on other records I could play around with them and make my own versions and stuff and even if it sucked there was already far better versions of these songs elsewhere. The ideas I came up with rarely sounded like those songs that I was actually covering and I started taking those ideas and putting them into my own songs with my own chords and words. Then one day I was sitting in my bedroom and I thought of the \"I'm checkin' out\" line in \"Sweet Home Cananada.\" and I liked it a LOT and didn't want to forget it, so I recorded it on my computer with Garageband and the 'internal microphone' which is located SOMEWHERE that I don't know. I really liked it, played it for some people and they liked it too. I already knew I kinda wanted to start a band based on certain ideas, but now I had a song to do it with too. After that, I started recording every idea I had, 60% of them were good. Eventually they slowly and surely became songs. These recordings were mostly done in a bedroom with a Powerbook computer, MBox, ProTools and a one-hundred dollar microphone called the Oktava MK-319 (except for \"sweet home cananada which was recorded on the Powerbook's internal microphone) . Some vocals were recorded at the Fad's practice space so I didn't have to piss off my neighbors by cursing as loudly as possible well past dinnertime. I also inclued \"Future 86\" which was a song I recorded last summer in my bedroom with a SM-58 and Cool Edit. Also, there are backing vocals on that by The Arrogant Sons of Bitches (recorded in a van), The Know How and around 100 kids in a barn in Massachusettes.",

        "explanation": "The two hardcore songs on the album are both revolved around a string of thoughts I had on the subway, possibly while drunk. I had written a lot of songs while I lived in Manhattan while riding subway trains or walking around and while they generally sucked, I could always salvage some of the melodies and make them into different better songs. Anyway, I hadn't been in New York for a real long time and I had scrawled down a bunch of notes/chords and the words \"Blow Your Brains Out on Live TV!!!\" All that stuff didn't really work together, so I took that chorus and added it to a song that I wrote in my girlfriend's basement in Buffalo during the five minutes that I decided I wanted to have a strictly 80's hardcore band. This was around the time that Bush got re-elected and that guy killed himself at the WTC site and I thought that was a bold protest statement for whatever reason. So I was in the shower and I was thinking about Bud Dwyer and the infamous moment when he killed himself in front of Congress or whoever it was and how he's famous now. Fox was saying \"some stupid protester kills himself because of Bush and disgraces 9/11\" which I always think is bullshit. I was in the shower thinking about this and thought about \"Hey Man Nice Shot\" which I believe is about that dude and how when I went to school, we visited the Museum of Television and Radio and they talked about crazy shit like that which gets televised. The point of this story is that name-checking Filter and the Museum of Television and Radio in the same sentence is one of the only things I've ever written that I look at people and say \"see... see... i can be funny too\" with my eyes.",

        "explanation": "So I guess this song is kind of the mission statement of Bomb the Music Industry! in a way because I wrote the lyrics after seeing people in bands just try and be so fucking cool all the time. Then I stayed at the Know How house for a bunch of days and here was a band that WAS really cool and just aren't image conscious. The second half of this song was partially written in a motel six in New Orleans with Sean Qualls. The two of us decided that we like each others' songs and since we're in ASOB together, we should write songs together and they'd be awesome. We wrote this song that had so many parts that I obviously wrote and so many parts that he obviously wrote and we couldn't get anything good. Except for the first like three minutes of the song which were this one part, which has been condensed for your listening pleasure. Oh yeah, a lot of the lyrics to this one are still being worked on so BEAR WITH US!!! (music by jeff rosenstock and sean qualls)",

        "explanation": "To those in the know, it's pretty fucking obvious what this damn song is about.

It's also about the machine that a band creates when it decided to buy a van, sell merch, put out records, et cetera. Plain and simple. No universal message. Yeah, me neither.",

        "explanation": "I had never written a nice song about anyone ever and I'm really not sure why. Anyway, this is the first and only nice song I've ever written about a person so far. I had written the vocal melody in my head while I was just around Washington Square Park and I RAN home to 3rd Ave. and 14th St., waited for an elevator for a few minutes and ran and wrote it down. I couldn't think of anything angry to write on top of it, so I wrote a song about staying in one room all day with someone you love, watching tv, having sex, drinking booze and eating ice cream. When I was refining the lyrics I realized this isn't so much a love song as it is an alcohol song. Then I added the part about nailing everyone else's feet to the ground so they can't move thus they can't come over and bother me. At that point the song just became wrong.

        "explanation": "This is a song by Harvey Danger and is a piano ballad in it's original form. I always liked it though, especially the lyrics which Harvey Danger always do exceedingly well. This was one of three songs I was thinking of covering (\"Bastards of Young\" by the Replacements and \"Wave of Mutilation\" by the Pixies were the other two) when I decided to see how all my recording shit worked. I actually wanted to put out mini-EPs of cover songs every month, a different artist every month but that turned out to be too much work after I started dealing with this one. For some reason, the tracks to this song were always allocated to my computer (small hard drive) instead of my hard drive (big hard drive) so it became almost impossible at the end to mix it in any way whatsoever. When recording the vocals and guitar parts, there was all this delay because the computer had to process everything, so I had to go in and line all the tracks up by hand, and then the computer would tell me there wasn't enough memory to do THAT, i'd have to restart it and do a little bit more and repeat. So this was a royal pain in the ass and doesn't sound too great but it's the best I've got. It's a shame because I really really do like the song, and the arrangement should have been pretty cool. But I'm also relieved I didn't do this on any of the songs I wrote. (from the album \"King James Version\" by Harveey Danger)",

This was recorded for ASOB, but when it came time to re-record it, everything sounded a lot more forced and less natural than the original demo, so we opted to keep this version instead and just add the band singing background vocals. We recorded two tracks of vocals on the way to a show in a barn in Massachusettes, one in the back of the van, one in the front. Once we got to the barn, we handed out lyric sheets to all the kids, played this song and said \"if you wanna sing vocals on the album version of this song, stick around after the show.\" We got probably 80 or 90 kids to stick around and sing and clap and the Know How guys did the same. It was a lot of fun, but I decided to put it on this because the compilation it was recorded for never really came out and this is the ultimate bedroom rock and roll song.",

    "description": "\"To Leave or Die in Long Island\" by Bomb the Music Industry!, released in 2005, is a seminal album that epitomizes the band's distinctive blend of punk, ska, and indie rock. Led by the creative force of Jeff Rosenstock, the album captures the essence of DIY ethos as it was recorded entirely on a laptop with minimal resources. The tracks navigate themes of disillusionment, self-discovery, and the challenges of young adulthood, with Rosenstock's raw and emotive vocals serving as the driving force. The album's eclectic instrumentation and energetic performances create a dynamic and engaging sonic experience, showcasing Bomb the Music Industry!'s commitment to pushing musical boundaries and challenging traditional industry norms. \"To Leave or Die in Long Island\" stands as a testament to the band's authenticity, innovation, and influence within the alternative music scene.",
    "explanation": "I started writing songs for this record almost immediately after Album Minus Band was done, but the tricky thing about it was that I started working so much more. It became really difficult to find time after an eight hour work day to crank up your guitar in a way that wouldn't piss off the neighbors, so they wouldn't call the cops. I tried to find time on the weekends, but after suffering from a little bit of writer's block, my girlfriend eventually moved into my house with my parents while she started looking for a job. This left me very little time to actually sit and have fun recording stuff. So I did what any idiot would do, I started growing a beard. I would not shave off the beard until I finished this EP. This wasn't a cold weather beard that insulates and protects your face. No. This was a sweaty, gross, ninety degrees in a fucking basement with no air-conditioning beard. I eventually started working harder to make some time to do this, and the EP slowly turned into a full-length record. This record is about living in a place that you feel you really don't relate to and don't belong in. Whether it's the musical gangs, the ass-kissing, the cokeheads or the desperate attempts of other people to hit it big, for me this record was about how I was going to get out of this fucking place. It was all written in Long Island and it is very expressive of my hope to go around the country playing stupid songs for people who will forget me again. There were a few songs that felt out of place and not fully completed, so I was left with this really weird amount of songs and minutes - too much for an EP, too little for an LP. So let's call this batch of MP3s a ten-inch.",

        "explanation": "This song probably took the longest out of any Bomb the Music Industry! song I've ever written to finish, and that's mainly because it was predicated on ridiculousness. The introduction was originally crafted to kick off “John Starks: Motherfucker”, a mini-punk-rock-opera based on the New York Knicks losing the 1994 Eastern Conference Finals, which I felt was the first time in my life I had a panic attack. I eventually decided to whittle it down to a two and a half minute song, but trying to write lyrics relating missing lay-ups to social anxiety to punk rock to the depressing nature of interacting with fake people all day... well, it wasn't that it was tough as much as it was trite. It was boring and forced. My plan to place constraints on myself to write something outside of my own voice that was a bit different had become a failed experiment. During 2005 I had a job as a graphic designer at a venue in Long Island, and ended up seeing quite a few hardcore shows because of it. When I was a kid, I was originally attracted to hardcore because I didn't feel like I was connecting with whatever it was the rest of the kids in junior high were feelin'. It pissed me when tough guys would start fights because it felt a lot like football, and watching hardcore shows today in Long Island, it has actually escalated to the point where gangs are involved. I feel like gangs are so against the punk rock mentality of thinking for yourself. Y'know, only in fucking Long Island. Eventually I clearly realized that this issue was something I felt a bit more passionately about than John Starks. Speaking of passionately, the moral of this song is that if you make out with a member of a hardcore gang, he'll probably leave you alone because he is most likely a homophobe.",

This song was meant to congratulate John because we all truly felt he was going to get this gig. This song was also meant to yell at John because his getting this gig would definitely have held up BTMI! a bit. It turns out that his friends forgot to make phone calls until it was too late and they already got the guy from Between The Buried And Me to do it, which allowed John the necessary free time to play the few shows we'd had in 2005. This song is mainly inside jokes, and also part rumor that I heard in a magazine which said ETID's newest album would be produced by Dave Grohl. I think I read that in Revolver. Punk rock, man.",

When there was a house party though, it kinda sucked to have to put the drinking to an end because I had to clean myself. Unlike most punk rockers, I like to shower as much as possible - it's my little bit of OCD. After the first time I decided that “hey, i could fucking drink beer while i shower,” not only did the night showers not seem so bad - I found myself showering at parties even when I didn't have to. So I figured that'd be something to write a song about. So I told James Lynch.

Eventually, this song ended up being one of the very few songs I have that show that I listen to Neutral Milk Hotel and the Arcade Fire. The words are partially about a friend of mine who has done some amazing things when she drank. They're also partially about drinking unholy amounts and still not getting drunk which is the WORST feeling ever. Not much electric guitar in this song, quite a bit of fuzz bass... I used an amp called the Kasino Fever which has an insane amount of fuzz on it... the kind of fuzz that just can't be contained sometimes. Also, I used a set of resonator bells that used to be owned by Tommy Dorsey which is pretty crazy. OK. That's enough I bet.",

        "explanation": "This song was actually written a while before it was recorded as \"...And Now I Live In Athens.\" It was basically a response to a lot of people asking me about my former bandmates, whether I see them at all anymore, how it feels to have ditched them which I never saw it as the case. I just saw it as taking a breather. So this song was very much about what I felt was well worn territory within my songs: leaving it all behind! Wow! So it sat around for a little bit, and I really loved the song so I guess subconsciously I didn't wanna put it out with lyrics that I felt kinda half-assed about. Then one day I came into work and an owner at my job got everyone together in a circle and said \"Look, I don't know who you guys are necessarily or what you do, but I feel like we're a family here.\" What I later had heard from other people I worked with was that he brought up the term \"family\" to justify making paycuts to some pals of mine as some kind of effort to \"pull through together.\" By the end of the week, rumors had started floating around about a lot of people losing their jobs,and subsequently those rumors turned out to be true. About a day or two after this meeting, I was in the shower before a show and thought of the \"pack and get out fast, no going out with a blast\" line. I thought \"hey... maybe that's a better start to the song.\" When I left the shower, the subject matter of the song changed dramatically to kind of suit where I was when I wrote THIS thing and I ended up being happier with this than most of the songs I've ever written.",

        "explanation": "I wrote this song after I saw a couple of my friends start to get even MORE jobs and get promoted to better jobs and I felt like I was kinda staying stuck where I was. The positives of this were that I didn't have to wake up early and commute, I got to do something that was mildly creative and most importantly I didn't have to kiss anybody's ass or edge anyone out for the top. I also feel a lot better about making music when I don't have to do those things. It still stings quite a bit when your friends start lapping you, getting raises before you even get a career going but the truth is if you work too hard at anything, you're not gonna be clever or creative: you're going to be part of the 90% of the population that tries too hard to advance at what they're doing. So this song is about taking stuff at your own pace even if your future depends on it. It's also about how miserable that can make you. The song title is a reference to an old Born Against song. A lot of bands have taken that song title and made it their own and I felt that it would be REALLY CLEVER if I did it too. Also, the \"Everybody's clever nowadays\" vocal part was ripped straight from the Buzzcocks. This song was actually a very conscious attempt not to write a song with a million parts, considering I had just finished \"Dude...\" and that song seemed to have a lot going on. Verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, instrumental break, chorus. Simps.",

You have a mustache!\n[Patrick] So do you!\n[Spongebob and Patrick] Ohh... Aww... Ohh...\n\nI'm twenty-two and I live at home\nAnd I hate my shitty job and shitty wage\nI feel like I need an attitude adjustment\nWhen the transformation's over you can see it on my face\n\nGrow a 'stache and a beard and\nMove out to the woods\nDo the H.D. Thoreau thing and start feeling good\nDisconnect the phones and sever all the credit cards\n\nYou hate the options they present to you\nAnd everything is owned by someone lame\nHere's a lesson how to deal with corporatization:\nStick it to the man because the man don't own your face\n\nGrow a 'stache and a beard and\nMove out to the woods\nDo the H.D. Thoreau thing and start feeling good\nDisconnect the phones and sever all the credit cards\n\nYou say they're not much different than me\nI disagree. They're buying 200-dollar designer jeans\nThey drink martinis. I can't afford a shot of whiskey\nThe joke's on everyone but me\n\nYou wake up every day, and you go to that job interview. But before you go to your job interview, you shave off your beard. And you know what happens when you shave off your beard? 10 kids die in third world countries. 15 kids die in communist countries. and 20 kids die in socialist countries. Don't conform to Gilette. Don't conform to Schick. Don't conform to the Mach 3 Turbo. Don't conform to the Venus. Don't conform to the Mach 3, Don't conform to the Mach 3\n\nMY BEARD OF DEFIANCE!\nMY BEARD OF DEFIANCE!\nMY BEARD OF DEFIANCE!\nMY BEARD OF DEFIANCE!\n\nAnd then when you wake up in the morning and you go into work and your friends say 'that's a shitty beard,' you say, 'fuck you! you're a shitty fucking... non-beard-having...\n\nMY BEARD OF DEFIANCE!\nMY BEARD OF DEFIANCE!\nMY BEARD OF DEFIANCE!\nMY BEARD OF DEFIANCE!\nTAKE BACK THE BEARD! TAKE BACK THE WORLD!\n",
        "explanation": "Unless you live and work in Williamsburg (or Park Slope I guess) or you're in a successful indie/math rock band that does not need to has real jobs, I truly feel that growing a beard is a very rebellious act, it's the spikes and hair dye for twenty-somethings. Let me tell ya, if you're a guy, you can grow some kind of beard once you hit your early twenties. Even if you don't have much facial hair, you can grow something. It'll look like shit for a while sometimes: when I grow a beard it looks awful until about a month in. But then one day you'll wake up and see \"holy fuck! I have a beard!\" Now, as for the rest of the world, they don't really like beards. If you're going to a job interview, you should shave off your beard if you want the job. If you're going out to meet ladies at a club, you should shave off your beard. Isn't that ridiculous? You'll know your true friends if they stick with you while growing a beard! With that said, this song was nothing more than an attempt to write the greatest breakdown in recent hardcore history, something to challenge \"Sunshine The Werewolf\" by Dillinger Escape Plan, and we will play it loud until spin kicks happen. As far as the lyrics go, it's difficult to take beards seriously as a listener. I bet it's also difficult to take a line like \"Stick it to the man, because the man don't own your face\" seriously. But come on, there's SOME truth in there, right?",

You don't own me!\n\nI worked my ass off my entire life to accomplish my dream\nIt started happening and everything got bastardized by greed\nI said \"pull this shit over and let me out\nI swear to fucking God I'm fucking giving up right now\"\nAnd now I've got a brand new start and I realized sometimes things are great\n\nScream it in apartment halls -\nScreaming shit in shopping malls -\nTake a ball point pen and paint the inside's of your eyelids with the constant reminder:\nYou don't own me. You don't own me\n\nThen I was underground without food, sunlight, or encouragement\nDepression set in, I was a product of my environment\nAnd then the other day, you said, “Jeff, get in your car\nYeah, pick Glenn Tillbrook up at the hotel and take him to the bar.”\nHe wore a t-shirt just like me and wasn't on his phone\nAnd for fifteen fucking minutes I had a conversation with my hero\nI'll be mad for the next ten years\nAnd after that we'll go drink beers until the bar runs out of beers\nPrepare for the next twenty-three years\n\nAnd if I wasn't a fat kid in high school\nI would have never listened to punk rock\nAnd if I knew how to throw a football\nI would have never played any music\nAnd if I never got my heart broken\nI would sing \"blah blah fucking nothing.\"\nAnd if you didn't fuck my ex-girlfriend\nI would still owe you three-thousand dollars\nAnd if I never lived in that van\nI wouldn't have met Chris or Steve or James, Alex or Middagh\nAnd if I never worked in a basement\nI would have never quit my job\nAnd if I had a big emo band or dropped out of college\nI would have never met you, man\n",
        "explanation": "This song took forever because I really wanted to capture the themes from the beginning of the album and implement them in a way that didn't sound forced but also didn't sound predictable. I had at least a dozen A B A' B B' C A structure patterns written down for it, always wanting to do more but being painfully well aware that if a song is longer than four minutes it better HAVE to be longer than four minutes. Cutting out a lot of the repitition in verses and vocal patterns and stuff really seemed to take away from how I wanted the song to build, and finding the right place to put the themes in proved to be a pain in the ass. So I tried it a bunch of different ways, and eventually I just cut a little bit of junk out so it kinda sounds like 20-second blasts of different genres whether it be alt-country, post-punk, reggae or synth pop. I dig it. There are one or two REALLY bad punches in this mix that jump out at me every time I listen to it, and I really should have caught them earlier and fixed them but I was so happy to have this thing done. The song was about how I was fed up with wasting my time in my shitty town with my shitty job. Then one day, Glenn Tillbrook played at my club and I volunteered to pick him up. He hung up his phone when he got in my car, we talked about my old band, his old band, the music industry, my ideas for Bomb the Music Industry! and a bunch of other stuff. When you talk to the guy who wrote \"Pulling Mussels From A Shell\" and he turns out to be a cool dude who is a lot like you and your friends, you kinda realize that life isn't always shitty. I thought about a couple of moments in the past few years that I wouldn't trade for any amount of money, success or freedom and figured, fuck, I guess I'll write ONE song that isn't all whine and no dine.",

    "description": "\"SKA DREAM,\" released by Jeff Rosenstock in 2020, is a unique and genre-bending album that presents a ska reinterpretation of the same songs featured in his critically acclaimed 2020 release, \"NO DREAM.\" This creative endeavor showcases Rosenstock's versatility and willingness to experiment with his own material. The album pays homage to his ska punk roots from The Arrogant Sons of Bitches days while injecting a fresh and spirited energy into each track. With its lively brass arrangements, catchy melodies, and Jeff's distinctive vocals, \"SKA DREAM\" stands out as a vibrant and entertaining reimagining of the original songs, offering fans a new perspective on familiar tunes within the realms of ska and punk.",
    "explanation": "The very good idea to make this record came together when, like many other bands throughout this pandemic that refused to participate in super spreading events, we were trying to find a fun way to make some music together to share with people. Otherwise we were just spending our evenings texting the group chat in dread about the collapsing world around us. Not the most fun band activity.\n\nAs with most things ska in my life, what started out as a fun goof with friends eventually morphed into “Hey, what if we tried to make it good though?” All of us have a pretty deep history playing and touring the country in punk/ska bands. We all understand the stigma that comes along with ska, we've all dealt with the pitfalls of it, and we've all kept on truckin' regardless. If you are one of those people who loves music as long as it isn't ska, that's cool, we see you. This record isn't for you and you don't have to listen to it. Byeeee. Okay, everyone else, we see you too, we love you and check it out, SKA DREAM is real.",

She told us it's been rough and you deserved a break and marrying that guy, obviously was mistake - you had a couple kids but now he's always gone and you're stuck sweeping hair at your mommy's hair salon.\n\nThe flat you have upstairs, tucked in the suburbs safe, is running low on bread and other amenities 'cause your mom's been secretly renting your place.\n\nDan,\nYour elevator looked in hella disrepair but I'm not fuckin' with a dozen flights of stairs. I tenderized my legs somewhere in Germany trying to convince the bored to pay attention to me. The absinthe that we drank? I'm not sure it was real. Massage place in the building? We know what's the fuckin' deal 'cause fratboys wait outside, pretending their not there, avert their glassy eyes, but I don't really care.\n\nI don't wanna lay in bed and stare at the ceiling\nWhile chasing the fleeting\nThere's too much in my head to sleep\nAnd I did the thing that movie said,\n“Foot on the floor beside the bed”\nStill too much in my head to sleep tonight.\nGet fucked up, break your stupid bones again.\nGet fucked up, lose your telephone again.\nGet fucked up, bother all your friends again.\nGet fucked up, shame your broken heart again.\n\nI really gotta leave, but I just wanna stay. I'm only a real person for a quarter-dozen days until I gotta scram, until I go away and turn into a person that I didn't want to be - cultivating mold on my laundry and becoming so afraid I'm honestly placing bets on a chemical crapshoot with my brain.\nCleaning for the dealer so I'll black out on the plane.\nMumbling in the dark and living vicariously\nThrough a photo album in a stranger's BNB.\n",

Why would they assume I'm cool with where it's from?” I murmur to you soaking in the sky.\n\nSoon enough it can't get any darker, we'll toss and turn once it starts getting hotter.\n\nYou could give me an ultimatum with a loaded gun, I still can't tell you what day of the week we're on. Some days I blink and suddenly it's night and I broke my promise - didn't go outside. Dust collects the second that you wipe it off. Too late to vacuum but not too late to toss the roaches I discarded late at night that piled up in the ashtray over time.\n\nIt feels indicative of a disaster\nA manifestation of ambitions shattered\nAnd I'll lean into it, keep getting sadder,\nIt doesn't mean that it really matters.\n\nIt doesn't mean that it really matters.\nYeah honestly, it doesn't even matter.\nEverything's not just a fucking omen.\n\nUnder the blanket in our messy home let's remind each other what we're doing right 'cause seek for cracks and surely we will find. Yeah, seek for cracks and surely ye will find don't seek for cracks when everything is fine.\n",
