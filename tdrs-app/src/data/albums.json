    "description": "Built to Fail is the first offical album by The Arrogant Sons of Bitches. It was initally released on Breaking the Law Records in 1998, but the band was unimpressed with the inital release of the album and later self-released it with a colored cover. Some of the songs appeared previously on Integrity. The cost of the album was $1000 to create a 12 song album, although occasionally a 13th song is added on. A year later in 1999, four more tracks were recorded for the album, although never released offically and only appearing on various burned CDs and the Discography Compilation. The sound is a lot more hardcore and speedy than later releases, as well as being far more edgy lyrically. In 2002 the band worked on a remastered version called Built to Fail 2, but it never got released.",

We did it as a joke because, well, we knew everyone hated Green Day but they all knew the words cause they bought the album when it was cool. We got booed off the stage, but since it was in my backyard we stayed on the stage, even though our drummer left. Regardless, I wrote this song while walking to John's house from school one day in my head, picked up a guitar and played it. He probably doesn't remember this. Quality song."

Won't fight. Won't run\n\nAbnormality\n\nWhat's going on around me?\nLacking common sense, stimulate and breed\nReject all knowledge yet I'm the abnormality?\nI was never one to be so cool and punk\nI just think I dig the tunes a little bit more than you\nAnd when your mind is warped by pro-elitist junk\nThat's a real bad path to choose.

I felt like in trying to be myself I had become this fucked up person that everybody just hated, not because I was different, just because I had the nerve to be into the same stuff as them. Life isn't a camp sport club where you get shut out if you arrive after the first twenty kids. This song is about all those people who would just say that I was a big ass poseur. Guess I am. I like 311. As far as songwriting goes, Joe played the opening riff to me over the phone, I said \"Joe, I have to finish this song, bye\" and I called him once or twice exchanging riffs."

I was playing a show at a church and I had to be worried after the show that I was going to get my ass kicked by somebody for no reason at all. This was a real punk rock hardcore kid, wearing a Gorilla Biscuits shirt and everything, and obviously ignoring the message that the Gorilla Biscuits try to convey. I have no qualms with this person now, but he just wanted to fuck me up that night along with many of his other friends. That's when I started to hate punk rock and all the shit that comes with it. Once again, its all about making friends with the right people or else you're not a real punk. This song was written by me and Chris Valentino and intended originally for Nothing Rhymes With Orange but that wasn't the direction the band wanted to go in. I eventually quit."

(Blurb 1)\n\nOK, for explanations of lyrics on most of these just scroll up and find the song on the big list. This was the first thing we ever recorded decently, meaning not on a tape recorder. Hard to believe huh? I think it was in the fall of 1997. It consisted of me on guitar bass and vocals, Joe on guitar and Joe Vazquez on the mixing board and acting as engineer. I was pretty nervous so I couldn't sing loud yet, and our equipment was absolutely terrible. First thing we ever recorded though. (Blurb 2)\n\nThis is just terrible, but also my favorite version of this song. Why? 1) I start laughing in the middle. 2) The unneccessarily loud screaming of \"pick it up\" 3) The extra dissonant octaves. 4) The drunken stupor at the end. (Blurb 3)\n"

Basically, we were both in Nothing Rhymes With Orange together, and he used to follow me to ASOB practice and stuff (in all fairness, the first time he came I asked him there so I could borrow his guitar pedal). So, just to be a pain in the ass I wouldn't let him join the band even though we obviously needed him because I couldn't sing and play guitar at the same time. We did let him make a guest appearance however, with his crazy crazy guitar solo at the end of this song that used to be executed with a remote control and/or screwdriver. He also shouted \"Marge!\" like in that episode of the Simpsons where she wants to be a cop and runs under the garage door for a thrill. They cut that scene out of the syndicated version though."

So, I just wrote stuff that followed the riff, the song pretty much wrote itself. The only problem were the lyrics. I couldn't think of anything besides \"Where'd My Sleeve Go?\" because the song was called \"Where's My Sleeve?\" so, anyone who ever saw us play this prior to June 1998 knows that there were originally no real words. It was me complaining about girls and just screaming and dancing around like a fuck. Then one day Valentino was bragging to me about Nothing Rhymes With Orange being on the LI Ska Compilation 2 because their new bass player's girlfriend was Gary from Edna's Goldfish's sister. I THINK THAT'S THE STORY! Whatever, I said \"When's the deadline, Chris? ASOB's gotta get on this.\" We discussed what songs to use and eventually decided on sleeve because of its incredible simplicity. Only problem was, what could the words be. I took out a pen and started writing on a diner napkin just things that rhymes sleeve/steve pat/that/at/hat, etc. And that's how sleeve was born. Then I wanted John to try to write words cause he's a funny guy but he's shy like that so he said \"Jeff, I can't write.\" That was annoying, so I sat down with him told him to tell me stuff, made those words rhyme, wrote them down on a porno and he went in and sang them. Basically, this song makes no sense. But there's a reason for that as opposed to Mountain Dew."

Chris was supposed to write the lyrics because I knew he had probably learnt a lot of crap about government and socialism and stuff like that while he was away at college, but I wrote down some make shift lyrics until he would get around to writing better ones. He never got around to writing better ones, so on the album Pornocracy what you hear is an attempt at a political hardcore song by someone who knows little to nothing at all about politics, and what's wrong with this country. When you look at it that way, it is almost plausible."

        "explanation": "The longer that the release date gets pushed forward on our CD, the more ridiculous this song is. It was in the slew of songs that were written weeks before recording Built To Fail and we didn't have the time to prepare it (among those songs were The Pez Song, Margo and Jeff Get Dicked Over By Lots Of People, Piss Off a song that has still not been released due to the band's disdain for it and Animal a song that was recorded, but John couldn't play the drum beat fast enough for long enough so the song ended up being five and a half minutes so we scrapped it). Go Ska! was about the slew of recent ska bands that arose due to the popularity of ska in 1997. That was a good time to be a ska band, that's when people started listening to us. Then, once ska died down again people stopped listening to us. Of course, this song had to come out in the year 2000 when everybody has nearly forgotten about the short wave of ska popularity. Some call it stale, I call it innovative. (Blurb 1)\n\nGreat reason of why we don't have two trumpets (or any trumpets) anymore because it sounds so fucking out of tune unfortunately. This is great though, all of the shit was totally spontaneous this time around, me speaking to the little kid, the lets go ska!s, the R2D2 noises on my saxaphone, the ska! hep!s at the end. It was cool, too bad it sounded terrible. (Blurb 2)\n"

The old you\nYou're a cold hearted-fool\nYou swore to me that things were still cool. How untrue\nThe cards have been dealt and my hand doesn't exactly rule\nAs I looked at the sky, I was glad I didn't cry\nLove-- thrown away\nI'm happy that you are undauntedly mistreating me\nLook at my life you can't honestly say that I could\nAnd it would be better for us both\nSo what now I feel sick?\nI was right, did I have to be so cruel, like the moon\nHiding away as the sun shows the pain in the world\nNow my heart has been broke and you're the one crying\nIs this some sick joke?\nMaybe next time someone dicks in your crotch you'll pray that he chokes\nMonths-- thrown away\nYou pissed on my trust and that's always the way that I'll see you and me\nAnd as it stands now that's the way that it always will be\nSo we're done and in the end it wasn't all real fun\nYou're the one who ended up not being the one\nAnd as time passes by, its stands ever still and I just can't figure out why\nHeartsick disease\nYou hand-cooked me royally fucked with tomato and cheese\nI'm at ease, cause I don't care now\nHave fun the choice isn't me\nGood-bye again\nAs I tell myself over and over that's we'll still be friends, but I know\nIt won't be the same in the end\nHave fun in your life without me\nI know that I don't care about you\n",

        "explanation": "This was a song that I wrote in 1998 when my girlfriend left for college and said she wanted to see other people. I was upset, but I had to deal with it. Anyway, I later found out from a friend that she had slept with some other guy which really pissed me off because she couldn't have even have had the balls to tell me. I confronted her about it one night and directly after I wrote this song. A year and a half later I found the MIDI file I wrote for it on my computer and I thought it was really good. I had to try and remember the lyrics however, because I lost the original ones. I think that was a good thing because they're less emo and more funny now. I am friends with this girl now, and I feel really bad about this song, but, fuck it."

Tear borded lines apart\nLet's focus on what I call we. \"We're sooo ruling the scene\nI played with Edna's and Dan Deacon's friends with me.\"\nI'm not saying its trendy, but where's the variety\n\"You're skapunkemohardcore or you're not cool enough for me.\"\nIf you see Adam Geller never ever shake his hand\nJust kick him in the ass.

        "explanation": "The music to this song was written in about thirty seconds.  This was sometime during the winter of 1998/1999. Shortly thereafter, the lyrics were scrawled onto a brown paper bag and the whole piece committed to my one-track tape machine.  Parts of this song are basically ripped off from every hardcore band before 1987, the most obvious sources being Void, Negative Approach and Born Against. Originally intended for the semi-imaginary band Warehouse Value, it was officially recorded in November 1999 at Runaway Studio with myself playing drums, bass, guitar, and singing; my good friend Glenn Erlandsen contributing an additional guitar part that seems to have been obscured by layers and layers of noise.  I wanted the song to sound like shit.  That's the “punk rock” way.  The monstrous amount of echo on the vocals is also completely intentional. Since the song is about killing yourself, I figured it should sound really really scary.  How do they make people sound really really scary in the movies? Echo.  I'm serious. The Arrogant Sons of Bitches were so frightened by the song they included it on the album.  If it sounds a little out of place, it is because the rest of the band isn't as punk rock as myself.  Screw “Noise Reduction.”  Screw “Pop Sensibility.”  Screw “Being in Tune.”  Punk is an attitude, maaan!!! Anarchy!  Society!! Amenity!!!  Androgyny!!!! Remember these words so you can write them on your book-bag. Capitalism is for sissies.  Be hard-core.  Wear a wife-beater. Tear down your tree-house.  Toilet-paper your school.  Use lots of hyphenated words like Greg-Graffin.  Tell President Reagan to shove it!!!!!!!!!! (by Chris Baltrus)"

Well, its about high school and how teachers don't really teach kids to be themselves, they would rather just scare the shit out of their kids with their grades and power and deadlines and stuff like that. I later learned that if you know how to sweet talk teachers, you'll do fine, which is kind of shitty, but whatever. Initially we were going to cover the Guns n Roses November Rain and put that on our album somewhere else. This way, when kids heard we had November Rain on our album they would put on the track that said November Rain and it would be our song, not the Guns n Roses song. However, some people disagreed with that idea and we never learnt November Rain for our album so now the song title is kind of stupid."

A teacher that I had really respected and kind of admired took me aside during my lunch period and just pretty much yelled at me, called me a failure, told me that I was the most selfish person he had ever met stuff like that. He blamed something on me that wasn't necessarily my fault, and if it was it was an accident. But he was having a bad day, so he took it out on me. The next day I went to Washington D.C. to visit Chris Valentino with John and Dave. One night I was like \"John, let's write a song.\" So we went out in the hall, exchanged riffs, pulled a few people aside and said \"is this good?\" and they said \"yes.\" Then I tried writing lyrics, and I couldn't so Chris's friend suggested the \"walking away/calling me gay\" line which we kept. I ultimately wrote lyrics about the day that I gave up faith in everybody in the world and I realized that I have to do what makes me happy. To be a success inside, you can't try to impress other people with what you've done. If someone has high expectations, its easy for them to be let down. So, yeah, those are just a few key points in this crazy fun song."

        "explanation": "I had written this song on guitar but I couldn't think of any horn parts to go with it so when I went to Model UN with my school I asked Chris Valentino to write a horn part for it as I played an acoustic guitar. He took it from the classical piece Manin Veen that we played in the high school band. The song titled then melded from Men In Venus to Meg Intravenous to American Penis and then the Kid Rock song American Badass came out which kinda sucked cause then we seemed unoriginal, but the album is coming out so late that people have probably forgotten that awful song by now. Anyway, the lyrics of this song were about a period where we would play late shows on week nights when we'd have to be in school the next morning at 7:42. It seemed that no one besides ourselves thought it was a good idea. There were no people there, my girlfriend was upset that we couldn't spend time together, my friends thought my band sucked, my parents thought I should concentrate on school, etc. So I wrote a song about it, and also how much not better life would be if we were some big name band all over the place. The second part of this song is about a dance that I went to for school. I didn't want to go at all, but someone begged me to so I said \"Fine\". It turned out that my blue hair didn't suit well with the status quo of our high school and I was barred from going out afterwards with my pseudodate and her friends to a fancy restaurant. I went with my girlfriend, and Chris Valentino + his date to T.G.I.Friday's. So its about how prejudgments of people are annoying."

(whoa yeah)\nIt used to be like we could talk all night and day\nBut now you have strayed far away from me\nWe could talk together **** and yell in peace\nBut I didn't buy you out, you were just a lease\nI've had you on my mind all night\nYou mean so much to me\nWell I guess that once I let go giving up will come more easily\nRefill on my coffee, another sleepless night\nNot knowing who is wrong, but I know I'm not right\nHad some good intentions, I had good intentions to keep\nBut if I keep on crying, maybe I'll cry myself to sleep\nI've heard a lot of condescending understatements from your gender\nLong before you were around\nOf course you're not the one for me right now cause you're not here for me\nBut I call anyway to hear your voice sound (whoa yeah)\nI gotta give up find myself\nI gotta give up by myself\n",

        "explanation": "At one point in his life, John was the biggest fucking womanizer ever, which is a shame because he's a teddy bear deep down inside his anus (john likes anus jokes). He was going out with this girl for like two days and then his friend for Oregon visited and he had sex with her after dating this other girl for TWO DAYS! Then John begged for the other girl again once his Oregon friend had left. He hates it when people talk about this. Anyway, I wrote this song about him taking advantage of women which he doesn't really do, but I thought it was funny. It was initially going to be the theme song for our non-existant band with Perry Carbone, the Monosexuals. However, being that we were non-existant, we never played or recorded that song and it became ours by default."

Not being able to finish the song, and knowing that I had a certain knack for writing angry songs about girls breaking my heart, in between drags of mentholated cigarettes, Joe said \"Hey, Jeff finish this one off.\" Unfortunately, at present time I was not upset about any girls in particular because I had a little romance bloomin' in my life. So, the day before I started going out with my girlfriend of roughly two years now I wrote this angry song about a girl who didn't really exist. It was a conglomerate of all the excess pain I had went through after previous break-ups and whatnot. I passed that shit like a motherfuckin' kidney stone. Oh yeah, half of the words of this song were taken from a different song which had lyrics about those girls that you really can't stand yet you can't stay away from them. The word fuck is used too many times. Hell yeah."

I don't know\nIn my head I've got all the explanations that I need\nThat not a motherfucker in the world would believe\nAnd I fail. Remarks misheard callously\nThe notes we passed in class never had an effect on me\nYou win. You've beat me at my own game\nBut you're not gonna be there when I've won\nI'm sure I'm not as bad as I think, but I feel like I've done nothing\nAnd now I'm at the brink of zero\nAnd I ain't got no souvenirs\nFrom the last few years that could fucking show\nThat I've attained some form of success\nA love I'll never find or notice\nHow much of this makes any sense\nSellout now or I'm never gonna win\nWho needs to give a motherfucking shit about my fucking friends?\nThe hand on the clock reaches my end\nBop Bada Bop\nIt's not me\nI know that I made you see the directionless slacker I made myself out to be\nWell you, win. It doesn't matter\nI'm not gonna be there when you're gone\nI don't need your advice and I don't need your help\nWhy am I so lonely if I still have myself?\nWhy should I care if I don't have a chick\nTo take all of my cash and hurt me till I'm sick?\nIt all makes such sense, its all loud and clear\nI may have had a bad week, a bad month, a bad year but the future's there\nAnd all I've got to do is concentrate on what I want\nAnd if you oppose me, fuck you\n",

It was a song that I wrote about feeling depressed because my life wasn't really turning out to be as great and as impressive as I hoped it would as a little kid. When I was in elementary school I was like getting straight A+'s and somewhere along the way something happened and I was no longer smarter than everyone else. But fuck that, because life isn't and shouldn't be about pleasing other people. When you feel empty inside, that void can't be filled up with drugs, girls, money or acceptance. You have to accept yourself. I just realized that this album has some pretty depressing lyric material, I must have been upset while I wrote these songs."

I had a summer where I hardly worked (which is like every summer), and I just had lots of spare time to try and get something done with my band or make money or do anything. Well, I did nothing, and at the end of the summer I felt like I was worthless. So, this is about seizing the day and all that shit."

    "description": "Three Cheers For Disappointment is the 3rd and final studio album released by The Arrogant Sons of Bitches. Recording on the album initally began soon after Pornocracy in late 2000. The album would be worked on behind other projects until general recording was done circa 2002. These initial recordings are avaiable on the first cd release of the album, and are very obviously incomplete. Further recording is done all the way up to 2004, where it was mostly complete other than a few extra recordings done entirely by Jeff later on. In 2005, the final touches were added to the album and it finally reached a completed state. It finally released in 2006 after over 5 years of being in production, being their most accomplished album. It's the only ASOB album to come to streaming and is generally the easiest album to find both digitally and physically.",
    "explanation": "Non-liner notes from 2009: I just finished hand typing all of these liner notes and lyrics 'cause I hadn't had them saved. I will not bore you with too many particulars but I feel like it would be a re-issue without something a little extra? So I will say that listening back to this (after not doing so for about three years) that I'm still pretty proud of it and not even horribly embarrassed by most of the lyrics (maybe \"the winter knocked on my door like a selfish bitch\" is pretty bad)... also what a good job Steve did recording and what a good job Alan did mastering. Shit!\n\nSo I guess aside from that I'll only tell two very short stories about the recording of this record. First of all, let's get off the subject. Steve likes to smoke a lot of pot and put a ton of reverb and delay on Pro Tools sessions for fun. This makes him an excellent person to hang out with all the time. Anyway, many nights at Moontower ended with a lot of pot (which was funny 'cause we were never really that kind of band), us playing the South Park N64 game and drinking beer from the vending machine in the studio (labeled \"Duff\" and \"Fudd\") until we passed out. Another fun thing to think about is that we recorded the timpanis and Christmas bells (which I still don't know the official name of) at East Meadow High School, where Sean had graduated years earlier... I think he even skipped his last exams while we were on tour. So whenever you hear a bell think about a bunch of dudes in their early twenties, smoking cigarettes, running around with computers and microphones and cursing while other high school classes were in session. I'm not even certain we had permission to be there.\n\nWhen this record was released we played three CD release shows that were to hopefully jump start the band or us being friends again after a slightly nasty fallout. At the end of the third one we all wanted to hang out and get a beer together, but we were obligated to sign like 200 posters for some fucking pre-order special that merch direct did. As we sat around signing shit instead of actually enjoying our accomplishment that we spent fucking YEARS on, spending time with our friends and relaxing... well, at that point I think we all knew that this was never gonna be a band again 'cause this is what being in this band would be like. I'm really happy to say we're all still buddies and definitely happy to see each other if we haven't for a while. And I'm pretty happy that after all this time, I'm still pretty pumped on this record.\n\nLiner notes from 2005: An embarrassing factoid about this record is that we've been trying to put it out for four years, thinking it was coming out and then having it fail, re-recording it, having My Chemical Romance release a hit album with almost the same exact album title and now we're pretty psyched it's finally here.\n\nSo let's chat a little bit, shall we? We were psyched that Steve Foote had offered to record us in Boston over the summer of 2004. His band had been on the Warped Tour on and off, and whenever he was home we drove up to Boston in our van, got a lot of parking tickets and lived in sleeping bags in Moontower Studios in Allston. We didn't even shower and it was kinda gross, and I'm not even sure we were supposed to live there, but about a month or so later we had 95% of a record. The great thing about Moontower was the bookshelf was filled with random instruments and we did our best to have them all somewhere on the album, even if it was shit that we didn't know how to use like the Kaos Pad. So back to that 95%... there were one or two parts that we didn't have time to do up in Boston, so I recorded some sax, percussion and vocal parts in various bathrooms, bedrooms and friends' practice spaces. One thing worth noting was that the gang vocals were recorded in a party atmosphere. We got a case or two of beer, invited all of our friends down and we had a very difficult time getting things done, but I still feel like it's important for a band to actually have a good time on a record... even if that meant some slurring.\n\nOriginal liner notes from 2003: What I remembered is that when I wrote this album that it was less a series of complaints and a stream of anger than it was a story about something I feel we all go through when we finally get out of high school and we are inundated with the feeling that we're free from rules. We don't have the teacher forcing us to go to class anymore. We are not a part of the system we all hated. Years later, I am still having trouble dealing with the fact that I am still part of the system that we all hated. The truth is the minute you feel you're breaking free of the big thing that is holding you down, you're already locked up again. Advertising. Finances. Friendship. Love. Life is business. I tried to avoid all the bullshit, I tried to be a musician and all I heard from my \"people\" was negativity. Ska is dead. Lose the horns. Tame the chaos. Drop the \"fuck\"s. If you do each of these things you will be successful financially. You will be commercially viable and saleable to record labels and corporations. They would shoot me down whenever I said that those things did not concern me. There were a thousand bands who would drop their convictions in three seconds if they were offered ten thousand bucks. We weren't one of them so people moved on to other acts.\n\nSo there we were, and that's where we are now. Unwelcome in our underground because our underground actually ended up being a system. Live everything else. I had always figured that the underground would be the one place we could break away from that system but thanks to MTV commodifying punk rock, this has been taken away from us. So I would like to invite you, the listener, the reader, to create a new underground. One where we actually don't have to follow any sets of rules. One where we don't have to be controlled by anyone but ourselves. This is an album about breaking out of that old system. hope you enjoy it fucker.\n",

We'll throw it in the pit as a sacrifice for middle-aged men and screaming girls. Your scene is full of shit so start killing it. Don't be the hypocrite. The last teary-eyed, thrift store mope star in the world.\n\nA victim of the latest hoax. The iconoclasts have lied and you're not in on the joke. Prove they're not what they claim to be (your money, they're gonna get your money.) Criticize all that I've said, 'cause if I wasn't so pretentious I'd cash in on the trend, do lines, double fist pills and O.D.\n\nStop singin' it! Stop singin' it! You're too serious! How can you crack a smile if you can't laugh at yourself? You think you're legit but you're just the idiot. Here's how to deal with it, bring the asshole and the douchebag level down.\n\nI'm not a part of your scene where fashion meets choreography. (your haircut is stupid, your pants are uncomfortable, you systematically plan every awkward forced guitar spin, your emotion is a joke, your emotion is a joke, your emotion is bullllllfuckingshit)\n\n(all your favorite bands do coke. sorry.)\n\nStop singing that shit we're tired of it. Stop singing it, oh, stop singing it. Kick the baggage and the ego to the ground. Stop singing that shit we're tired of it. Stop singing, oh, so I can kick the rotting carcass of your sound.\n",

I'm a waste of life, a waste of mind. Where's my ambition. Chalk up one girlfriend + two broken cars + my band + friends are nothing more than parting shots not taken. Look how jaded I can be!\n\nWhen I turned sixteen I already felt to old to be in this entire scene of sighing lazily at unaccomplished dreams.\n\nYeah, it's my home but I think it's time to go. I'll hit once more so I don't wake up. I got no home and I got nowhere to go. I just can't seem to get on top of this situation normal all fucked up.\n\nStill, I lay in bed and think of all the dreams I've had and clever remarks I have said. It seems like they all mean nothing. Snooze. Alarm reset. That's eight more minutes. This disaster can't exist because I'm not awake to live it. I can't seem to place where life went wrong. It's the wrong chords. It's one lame song. I never know the exist to get off at 'til it's passed.\n\nKick me in the ass. A free shot. Get it over with and kick me until I bleed. It seems that's all you need. Let's go! This one's on me!\n\nI don't think I'm going outside today. I'll stay in bed all day. Declare a personal holiday. So you can take my page right out of your phonebook. Burn my seven digits to ashes. I won't be awake in any of your classes. Light another smoke as this day passes.\n\nI don't think I'm going outside today. I'll stay in bed all day. Declare a personal holiday. So you can take my page right out of your phonebook.

    "name": "Album Minus Band",
    "description": "\"Album Minus Band\" by Bomb the Music Industry! is a groundbreaking release that emerged in 2004, representing a bold departure from conventional album production. Led by the creative force of Jeff Rosenstock, the album was recorded entirely in isolation, with Rosenstock playing every instrument himself. This DIY approach not only demonstrated his multi-instrumental prowess but also embodied the band's commitment to challenging industry norms. The result is a raw and intimate collection of songs that captures the essence of punk and indie rock, with lyrics reflecting themes of introspection, frustration, and the human experience. \"Album Minus Band\" stands as a testament to Bomb the Music Industry!'s ethos of creative freedom, setting the stage for their influential role in shaping the landscape of independent and alternative music.",
    "explanation": "The grand scheme of this whole thing happened as it was being written/recorded. I realized that a lot of ideas that I have never happen because I can't think of a good way to write them down. Then after I DO write them down, I don't remember EXACTLY how I thought they should go so I can give them to the other people I'm in a band with. When The Arrogant Sons of Bitches went on hiatus, I no longer had a band. For a while this made me think \"well, I have no reason to write music 'cause who's gonna play it.\" After giving up for a couple of months, I started working on a few cover songs including Harvey Danger's \"Pike St. - Park Slope.\" It was a lot of fun to take someone else's ideas and try and make them my own, and since those songs were already on other records I could play around with them and make my own versions and stuff and even if it sucked there was already far better versions of these songs elsewhere. The ideas I came up with rarely sounded like those songs that I was actually covering and I started taking those ideas and putting them into my own songs with my own chords and words. Then one day I was sitting in my bedroom and I thought of the \"I'm checkin' out\" line in \"Sweet Home Cananada.\" and I liked it a LOT and didn't want to forget it, so I recorded it on my computer with Garageband and the 'internal microphone' which is located SOMEWHERE that I don't know. I really liked it, played it for some people and they liked it too. I already knew I kinda wanted to start a band based on certain ideas, but now I had a song to do it with too. After that, I started recording every idea I had, 60% of them were good. Eventually they slowly and surely became songs. These recordings were mostly done in a bedroom with a Powerbook computer, MBox, ProTools and a one-hundred dollar microphone called the Oktava MK-319 (except for \"sweet home cananada which was recorded on the Powerbook's internal microphone) . Some vocals were recorded at the Fad's practice space so I didn't have to piss off my neighbors by cursing as loudly as possible well past dinnertime. I also inclued \"Future 86\" which was a song I recorded last summer in my bedroom with a SM-58 and Cool Edit. Also, there are backing vocals on that by The Arrogant Sons of Bitches (recorded in a van), The Know How and around 100 kids in a barn in Massachusettes.",

        "explanation": "The two hardcore songs on the album are both revolved around a string of thoughts I had on the subway, possibly while drunk. I had written a lot of songs while I lived in Manhattan while riding subway trains or walking around and while they generally sucked, I could always salvage some of the melodies and make them into different better songs. Anyway, I hadn't been in New York for a real long time and I had scrawled down a bunch of notes/chords and the words \"Blow Your Brains Out on Live TV!!!\" All that stuff didn't really work together, so I took that chorus and added it to a song that I wrote in my girlfriend's basement in Buffalo during the five minutes that I decided I wanted to have a strictly 80's hardcore band. This was around the time that Bush got re-elected and that guy killed himself at the WTC site and I thought that was a bold protest statement for whatever reason. So I was in the shower and I was thinking about Bud Dwyer and the infamous moment when he killed himself in front of Congress or whoever it was and how he's famous now. Fox was saying \"some stupid protester kills himself because of Bush and disgraces 9/11\" which I always think is bullshit. I was in the shower thinking about this and thought about \"Hey Man Nice Shot\" which I believe is about that dude and how when I went to school, we visited the Museum of Television and Radio and they talked about crazy shit like that which gets televised. The point of this story is that name-checking Filter and the Museum of Television and Radio in the same sentence is one of the only things I've ever written that I look at people and say \"see... see... i can be funny too\" with my eyes.",

        "explanation": "So I guess this song is kind of the mission statement of Bomb the Music Industry! in a way because I wrote the lyrics after seeing people in bands just try and be so fucking cool all the time. Then I stayed at the Know How house for a bunch of days and here was a band that WAS really cool and just aren't image conscious. The second half of this song was partially written in a motel six in New Orleans with Sean Qualls. The two of us decided that we like each others' songs and since we're in ASOB together, we should write songs together and they'd be awesome. We wrote this song that had so many parts that I obviously wrote and so many parts that he obviously wrote and we couldn't get anything good. Except for the first like three minutes of the song which were this one part, which has been condensed for your listening pleasure. Oh yeah, a lot of the lyrics to this one are still being worked on so BEAR WITH US!!! (music by jeff rosenstock and sean qualls)",

        "explanation": "To those in the know, it's pretty fucking obvious what this damn song is about. For those who aren't in the know, this is about all the pressures of being in a band that is about to break and feeling like if you DON'T break, you're personally responsible for all of it. It's also about the machine that a band creates when it decided to buy a van, sell merch, put out records, et cetera. Plain and simple. No universal message. Yeah, me neither.",

        "explanation": "I had never written a nice song about anyone ever and I'm really not sure why. Anyway, this is the first and only nice song I've ever written about a person so far. I had written the vocal melody in my head while I was just around Washington Square Park and I RAN home to 3rd Ave. and 14th St., waited for an elevator for a few minutes and ran and wrote it down. I couldn't think of anything angry to write on top of it, so I wrote a song about staying in one room all day with someone you love, watching tv, having sex, drinking booze and eating ice cream. When I was refining the lyrics I realized this isn't so much a love song as it is an alcohol song. Then I added the part about nailing everyone else's feet to the ground so they can't move thus they can't come over and bother me. At that point the song just became wrong.

He told me I should wear them all day through school and they cost like $500. He was also asking really intrusive questions for a dude I just met like \"DO YOU LIKE PAIN? DO YOU THINK OF KILLING YOURSELF? HAVE YOU EVER CUT YOURSELF? DO YOU SMOKE? YOUR MOM WANTS TO KNOW IF YOU SMOKE?\" I later assumed he was a goggle salesman in a fake office.",

        "explanation": "This is a song by Harvey Danger and is a piano ballad in it's original form. I always liked it though, especially the lyrics which Harvey Danger always do exceedingly well. This was one of three songs I was thinking of covering (\"Bastards of Young\" by the Replacements and \"Wave of Mutilation\" by the Pixies were the other two) when I decided to see how all my recording shit worked. I actually wanted to put out mini-EPs of cover songs every month, a different artist every month but that turned out to be too much work after I started dealing with this one. For some reason, the tracks to this song were always allocated to my computer (small hard drive) instead of my hard drive (big hard drive) so it became almost impossible at the end to mix it in any way whatsoever. When recording the vocals and guitar parts, there was all this delay because the computer had to process everything, so I had to go in and line all the tracks up by hand, and then the computer would tell me there wasn't enough memory to do THAT, i'd have to restart it and do a little bit more and repeat. So this was a royal pain in the ass and doesn't sound too great but it's the best I've got. It's a shame because I really really do like the song, and the arrangement should have been pretty cool. But I'm also relieved I didn't do this on any of the songs I wrote. (from the album \"King James Version\" by Harveey Danger)",

This was recorded for ASOB, but when it came time to re-record it, everything sounded a lot more forced and less natural than the original demo, so we opted to keep this version instead and just add the band singing background vocals. We recorded two tracks of vocals on the way to a show in a barn in Massachusettes, one in the back of the van, one in the front. Once we got to the barn, we handed out lyric sheets to all the kids, played this song and said \"if you wanna sing vocals on the album version of this song, stick around after the show.\" We got probably 80 or 90 kids to stick around and sing and clap and the Know How guys did the same. It was a lot of fun, but I decided to put it on this because the compilation it was recorded for never really came out and this is the ultimate bedroom rock and roll song.",

    "description": "\"To Leave or Die in Long Island\" by Bomb the Music Industry!, released in 2005, is a seminal album that epitomizes the band's distinctive blend of punk, ska, and indie rock. Led by the creative force of Jeff Rosenstock, the album captures the essence of DIY ethos as it was recorded entirely on a laptop with minimal resources. The tracks navigate themes of disillusionment, self-discovery, and the challenges of young adulthood, with Rosenstock's raw and emotive vocals serving as the driving force. The album's eclectic instrumentation and energetic performances create a dynamic and engaging sonic experience, showcasing Bomb the Music Industry!'s commitment to pushing musical boundaries and challenging traditional industry norms. \"To Leave or Die in Long Island\" stands as a testament to the band's authenticity, innovation, and influence within the alternative music scene.",
    "explanation": "I started writing songs for this record almost immediately after Album Minus Band was done, but the tricky thing about it was that I started working so much more. It became really difficult to find time after an eight hour work day to crank up your guitar in a way that wouldn't piss off the neighbors, so they wouldn't call the cops. I tried to find time on the weekends, but after suffering from a little bit of writer's block, my girlfriend eventually moved into my house with my parents while she started looking for a job. This left me very little time to actually sit and have fun recording stuff. So I did what any idiot would do, I started growing a beard. I would not shave off the beard until I finished this EP. This wasn't a cold weather beard that insulates and protects your face. No. This was a sweaty, gross, ninety degrees in a fucking basement with no air-conditioning beard. I eventually started working harder to make some time to do this, and the EP slowly turned into a full-length record. This record is about living in a place that you feel you really don't relate to and don't belong in. Whether it's the musical gangs, the ass-kissing, the cokeheads or the desperate attempts of other people to hit it big, for me this record was about how I was going to get out of this fucking place. It was all written in Long Island and it is very expressive of my hope to go around the country playing stupid songs for people who will forget me again. There were a few songs that felt out of place and not fully completed, so I was left with this really weird amount of songs and minutes - too much for an EP, too little for an LP. So let's call this batch of MP3s a ten-inch.",

        "explanation": "This song probably took the longest out of any Bomb the Music Industry! song I've ever written to finish, and that's mainly because it was predicated on ridiculousness. The introduction was originally crafted to kick off “John Starks: Motherfucker”, a mini-punk-rock-opera based on the New York Knicks losing the 1994 Eastern Conference Finals, which I felt was the first time in my life I had a panic attack. I eventually decided to whittle it down to a two and a half minute song, but trying to write lyrics relating missing lay-ups to social anxiety to punk rock to the depressing nature of interacting with fake people all day... well, it wasn't that it was tough as much as it was trite. It was boring and forced. My plan to place constraints on myself to write something outside of my own voice that was a bit different had become a failed experiment. During 2005 I had a job as a graphic designer at a venue in Long Island, and ended up seeing quite a few hardcore shows because of it. When I was a kid, I was originally attracted to hardcore because I didn't feel like I was connecting with whatever it was the rest of the kids in junior high were feelin'. It pissed me when tough guys would start fights because it felt a lot like football, and watching hardcore shows today in Long Island, it has actually escalated to the point where gangs are involved. I feel like gangs are so against the punk rock mentality of thinking for yourself. Y'know, only in fucking Long Island. Eventually I clearly realized that this issue was something I felt a bit more passionately about than John Starks. Speaking of passionately, the moral of this song is that if you make out with a member of a hardcore gang, he'll probably leave you alone because he is most likely a homophobe.",

        "explanation": "For any musician, a day job can be a pretty depressing thing - kind of a constant reminder that you're not successful or good enough to do what you feel is your strong suit for a living. So when John (our guitar player) found out that Every Time I Die's bassist quit last winter and at the same time realized that a couple of his friends were also good friends with the ETID gang, we all decided to celebrate. I mean, the only requirements for the band aside from the ability to play the bass was that you have to like AC/DC and you have to drink a lot... how could he not get it? This song was meant to congratulate John because we all truly felt he was going to get this gig. This song was also meant to yell at John because his getting this gig would definitely have held up BTMI! a bit. It turns out that his friends forgot to make phone calls until it was too late and they already got the guy from Between The Buried And Me to do it, which allowed John the necessary free time to play the few shows we'd had in 2005. This song is mainly inside jokes, and also part rumor that I heard in a magazine which said ETID's newest album would be produced by Dave Grohl. I think I read that in Revolver. Punk rock, man.",

        "explanation": "If you have never drank a beer in the shower, you're missing out on one of the finer things in life. When I was on tour with ASOB, the shower rotation went in a way that I was generally one of the people to shower at night - there was less stress of showering quickly and I didn't have to wake up early to do it. When there was a house party though, it kinda sucked to have to put the drinking to an end because I had to clean myself. Unlike most punk rockers, I like to shower as much as possible - it's my little bit of OCD. After the first time I decided that “hey, i could fucking drink beer while i shower,” not only did the night showers not seem so bad - I found myself showering at parties even when I didn't have to. So I figured that'd be something to write a song about. So I told James Lynch. He said “yeah... it could go 'the only reason i ever shower is so i can drink a showerbeer.” Once someone else gets in on a dumb song idea, I have to end up writing it.",

        "explanation": "It's pretty depressing to come back home from the life of living day to day and showing up in new places and having everyone pay attention to you and think you're this big awesome shit and being a part of that whole working thing again. When I was writing this, I was applying to about fifty jobs a week and getting no responses, which as someone who took out a lot of loans to go to school so this WOULDN'T happen, it just killed me. Oddly enough, all my friends from school seemed to be doing really well all my friends in bands seem to be doing really well with their bands and I'm still living with my parents and working in a basement for minimum wage because I can't afford to lose the job and ask for a raise. So, I was thinking about all of this shit and that Against Me! song \"8 Full Hours of Sleep\" was stuck in my head and I wanted to write a song like that really badly. Eventually, this song ended up being one of the very few songs I have that show that I listen to Neutral Milk Hotel and the Arcade Fire. The words are partially about a friend of mine who has done some amazing things when she drank. They're also partially about drinking unholy amounts and still not getting drunk which is the WORST feeling ever. Not much electric guitar in this song, quite a bit of fuzz bass... I used an amp called the Kasino Fever which has an insane amount of fuzz on it... the kind of fuzz that just can't be contained sometimes. Also, I used a set of resonator bells that used to be owned by Tommy Dorsey which is pretty crazy. OK. That's enough I bet.",

        "explanation": "This song was actually written a while before it was recorded as \"...And Now I Live In Athens.\" It was basically a response to a lot of people asking me about my former bandmates, whether I see them at all anymore, how it feels to have ditched them which I never saw it as the case. I just saw it as taking a breather. So this song was very much about what I felt was well worn territory within my songs: leaving it all behind! Wow! So it sat around for a little bit, and I really loved the song so I guess subconsciously I didn't wanna put it out with lyrics that I felt kinda half-assed about. Then one day I came into work and an owner at my job got everyone together in a circle and said \"Look, I don't know who you guys are necessarily or what you do, but I feel like we're a family here.\" What I later had heard from other people I worked with was that he brought up the term \"family\" to justify making paycuts to some pals of mine as some kind of effort to \"pull through together.\" By the end of the week, rumors had started floating around about a lot of people losing their jobs,and subsequently those rumors turned out to be true. About a day or two after this meeting, I was in the shower before a show and thought of the \"pack and get out fast, no going out with a blast\" line. I thought \"hey... maybe that's a better start to the song.\" When I left the shower, the subject matter of the song changed dramatically to kind of suit where I was when I wrote THIS thing and I ended up being happier with this than most of the songs I've ever written.",

        "explanation": "I wrote this song after I saw a couple of my friends start to get even MORE jobs and get promoted to better jobs and I felt like I was kinda staying stuck where I was. The positives of this were that I didn't have to wake up early and commute, I got to do something that was mildly creative and most importantly I didn't have to kiss anybody's ass or edge anyone out for the top. I also feel a lot better about making music when I don't have to do those things. It still stings quite a bit when your friends start lapping you, getting raises before you even get a career going but the truth is if you work too hard at anything, you're not gonna be clever or creative: you're going to be part of the 90% of the population that tries too hard to advance at what they're doing. So this song is about taking stuff at your own pace even if your future depends on it. It's also about how miserable that can make you. The song title is a reference to an old Born Against song. A lot of bands have taken that song title and made it their own and I felt that it would be REALLY CLEVER if I did it too. Also, the \"Everybody's clever nowadays\" vocal part was ripped straight from the Buzzcocks. This song was actually a very conscious attempt not to write a song with a million parts, considering I had just finished \"Dude...\" and that song seemed to have a lot going on.

Ohh...\n\nI'm twenty-two and I live at home\nAnd I hate my shitty job and shitty wage\nI feel like I need an attitude adjustment\nWhen the transformation's over you can see it on my face\n\nGrow a 'stache and a beard and\nMove out to the woods\nDo the H.D. Thoreau thing and start feeling good\nDisconnect the phones and sever all the credit cards\n\nYou hate the options they present to you\nAnd everything is owned by someone lame\nHere's a lesson how to deal with corporatization:\nStick it to the man because the man don't own your face\n\nGrow a 'stache and a beard and\nMove out to the woods\nDo the H.D. Thoreau thing and start feeling good\nDisconnect the phones and sever all the credit cards\n\nYou say they're not much different than me\nI disagree. They're buying 200-dollar designer jeans\nThey drink martinis. I can't afford a shot of whiskey\nThe joke's on everyone but me\n\nYou wake up every day, and you go to that job interview. But before you go to your job interview, you shave off your beard. And you know what happens when you shave off your beard? 10 kids die in third world countries. 15 kids die in communist countries. and 20 kids die in socialist countries. Don't conform to Gilette. Don't conform to Schick. Don't conform to the Mach 3 Turbo. Don't conform to the Venus. Don't conform to the Mach 3, Don't conform to the Mach 3\n\nMY BEARD OF DEFIANCE!\nMY BEARD OF DEFIANCE!\nMY BEARD OF DEFIANCE!\nMY BEARD OF DEFIANCE!\n\nAnd then when you wake up in the morning and you go into work and your friends say 'that's a shitty beard,' you say, 'fuck you! you're a shitty fucking... non-beard-having...\n\nMY BEARD OF DEFIANCE!\nMY BEARD OF DEFIANCE!\nMY BEARD OF DEFIANCE!\nMY BEARD OF DEFIANCE!\nTAKE BACK THE BEARD!

        "explanation": "Unless you live and work in Williamsburg (or Park Slope I guess) or you're in a successful indie/math rock band that does not need to has real jobs, I truly feel that growing a beard is a very rebellious act, it's the spikes and hair dye for twenty-somethings. Let me tell ya, if you're a guy, you can grow some kind of beard once you hit your early twenties. Even if you don't have much facial hair, you can grow something. It'll look like shit for a while sometimes: when I grow a beard it looks awful until about a month in. But then one day you'll wake up and see \"holy fuck! I have a beard!\" Now, as for the rest of the world, they don't really like beards. If you're going to a job interview, you should shave off your beard if you want the job. If you're going out to meet ladies at a club, you should shave off your beard. Isn't that ridiculous? You'll know your true friends if they stick with you while growing a beard! With that said, this song was nothing more than an attempt to write the greatest breakdown in recent hardcore history, something to challenge \"Sunshine The Werewolf\" by Dillinger Escape Plan, and we will play it loud until spin kicks happen. As far as the lyrics go, it's difficult to take beards seriously as a listener. I bet it's also difficult to take a line like \"Stick it to the man, because the man don't own your face\" seriously. But come on, there's SOME truth in there, right?",

You don't own me!\n\nI worked my ass off my entire life to accomplish my dream\nIt started happening and everything got bastardized by greed\nI said \"pull this shit over and let me out\nI swear to fucking God I'm fucking giving up right now\"\nAnd now I've got a brand new start and I realized sometimes things are great\n\nScream it in apartment halls -\nScreaming shit in shopping malls -\nTake a ball point pen and paint the inside's of your eyelids with the constant reminder:\nYou don't own me. You don't own me\n\nThen I was underground without food, sunlight, or encouragement\nDepression set in, I was a product of my environment\nAnd then the other day, you said, “Jeff, get in your car\nYeah, pick Glenn Tillbrook up at the hotel and take him to the bar.”\nHe wore a t-shirt just like me and wasn't on his phone\nAnd for fifteen fucking minutes I had a conversation with my hero\nI'll be mad for the next ten years\nAnd after that we'll go drink beers until the bar runs out of beers\nPrepare for the next twenty-three years\n\nAnd if I wasn't a fat kid in high school\nI would have never listened to punk rock\nAnd if I knew how to throw a football\nI would have never played any music\nAnd if I never got my heart broken\nI would sing \"blah blah fucking nothing.\"\nAnd if you didn't fuck my ex-girlfriend\nI would still owe you three-thousand dollars\nAnd if I never lived in that van\nI wouldn't have met Chris or Steve or James, Alex or Middagh\nAnd if I never worked in a basement\nI would have never quit my job\nAnd if I had a big emo band or dropped out of college\nI would have never met you, man\n",
        "explanation": "This song took forever because I really wanted to capture the themes from the beginning of the album and implement them in a way that didn't sound forced but also didn't sound predictable. I had at least a dozen A B A' B B' C A structure patterns written down for it, always wanting to do more but being painfully well aware that if a song is longer than four minutes it better HAVE to be longer than four minutes. Cutting out a lot of the repitition in verses and vocal patterns and stuff really seemed to take away from how I wanted the song to build, and finding the right place to put the themes in proved to be a pain in the ass. So I tried it a bunch of different ways, and eventually I just cut a little bit of junk out so it kinda sounds like 20-second blasts of different genres whether it be alt-country, post-punk, reggae or synth pop. I dig it. There are one or two REALLY bad punches in this mix that jump out at me every time I listen to it, and I really should have caught them earlier and fixed them but I was so happy to have this thing done. The song was about how I was fed up with wasting my time in my shitty town with my shitty job. Then one day, Glenn Tillbrook played at my club and I volunteered to pick him up. He hung up his phone when he got in my car, we talked about my old band, his old band, the music industry, my ideas for Bomb the Music Industry! and a bunch of other stuff. When you talk to the guy who wrote \"Pulling Mussels From A Shell\" and he turns out to be a cool dude who is a lot like you and your friends, you kinda realize that life isn't always shitty. I thought about a couple of moments in the past few years that I wouldn't trade for any amount of money, success or freedom and figured, fuck, I guess I'll write ONE song that isn't all whine and no dine.",

    "description": "\"Goodbye Cool World\" by Bomb the Music Industry!, released in 2006, is a defining moment in the band's discography, showcasing Jeff Rosenstock's uncompromising approach to punk rock. The album captures the raw energy and DIY ethos that define the band's sound, reflecting the turbulence and angst of the post-collegiate experience. With tracks characterized by frenetic punk beats, introspective lyrics, and a sense of urgency, the album explores themes of disillusionment, societal pressures, and the pursuit of individuality. Rosenstock's impassioned vocals and the eclectic instrumentation create a chaotic yet cohesive sonic landscape, making \"Goodbye Cool World\" a compelling and influential work in the punk genre. The album is a testament to Bomb the Music Industry!'s commitment to challenging conventions and staying true to their independent, innovative spirit.",
    "explanation": "This record is essentially the product of moving out of your house and into a creatively dismal area. While Forest Hills, Queens is a very safe area and I managed to snag a really nice apartment for a super low price it gets depressing to be surrounded by senior citizens, hasidic (sic?) jews and russians... I went my first month living here without seeing someone in their twenties, I went at least four months without seeing a single black person. All my friends seemed far away, I got very few visitors and I was too broke to even take the train to go out and visit people. That was the environment in which the album was written.\n\nNow as far as how in was recorded, this was done in an apartment building which meant recording needed to take place during the day, before dinner time, before the kids were home. Unfortunately, the record was pushed back a lot because my computer kept breaking. Once I got everything back on track, I ended up having a new temp job which was sweet because I had some money but TOTALLY lame because I could now only record between 5:30 and 6:30 every day. It finally got finished, and I'm proud to say that only two or three of the vocal tracks were recorded outside the apartment (those were done in Chris Valentino's pracitce space, thanks Chris.) So as usual, all songs were recorded on a laptop by Jeff Rosenstock with pretty much one microphone. Steve Foote (Big D and the Kids Table), James Brown (Beret!), Rick Johnson and Brendan Jensen (Mustard Plug) were kind enough to lend a hand on some of the tracks. Thanks to those guys. And big thanks to Christine Mackie, my wonderful girlfriend who let me record parts of these songs on her computer while mine was broke! Long live the internet!\n",

        "explanation": "This song underwent a massive transformation. It was always meant to be the first song on the new album, but initially I was trying to write something that sounded like Supergrass's \"Caught By The Fuzz\"... a quick fuzzy pop song with fun melodies and no extra fat. It ended up sounding more like Green Day, until I heard the melody at the beginning of this song in my head while I was pumping gas after leaving a temporary job which I made my rent off of. I wrote it down while driving, almost crashed, went to an all you can drink wine party, drank too much, came upstairs, listened to a lot of Botch and decided that the song should not be fun and poppy but spastic and glorious. It was originally titled \"Stylish Looks For The Young Professional\" and is about how people my age have started to take career-oriented paths in their lives that I find pretty ridiculous and impressive at the same time. Either way, there are plenty of people my age who are competing for promotions in the world of work, and screwing people over and I feel that they can have whatever it is they're trying to gain by doing that and I'll just ignore them. This song is an obvious Wrangler Brutes and Mclusky ripoff.",

So about Minneapolis... A lot of my favorite bands are from there and we were actually playing at my favorite band (Dillinger Four)'s club (The Triple Rock.) So finally playing there was a very exciting thing for me but due to overthinking and planning to \"drink to relax\" but then drinking so much that something very strange happened to me - everything in my head went from spinning and being confusing and whatever to EVERYTHING ABOUT MY LIFE BECOMING CLEARER THAN IT HAD EVER BEEN. And what was clear was that my life was a total joke. Did I kill myself? Wait 'til the sequel to see!!",

I wrote some of the words while on the last tour with Bomb the Music Industry! and getting used to playing smaller crowds and also being easily the oldest guy in the room. When you think too much and hang out with people after shows that are a different age group than you (older or younger), you start to wonder whether or not anyone could possibly care about your views or problems. That and you can't help but feel bad when someone offers you marijuana and you think that they're offering you money or food. So this song is about feeling out of touch with other people whether it's 'cause they're older, younger or just don't feel the same as you. Word.",

Oh!\n\nThat orange ball.\nThat burning orb of fire in the sky is gonna explode and we're all gonna die!\nExcept for the foolish few who will \"think ahead\" and drive their SUV's to their bomb shelters\nComplain about air conditioning because \"baby, we ain't got no more electricity.\"\nThey wanna rise when it's done, be a leader with a gun.\nBe a leader of what?

Every Fugazi record has a catalog number and a price tag and every independent label is selling you another goddamn product. But, NO, WE'RE not slaves to the music. Oh no, WE'RE not slaves to the company, baby.

The thing was, the cop didn't even remember that he gave me the ticket at 4 AM... he thought he had given it to me in the afternoon! So while I tried to object, the judge kept yelling at me and while driving to work straight from court in my girlfriend's car with no air conditioning I started thinking about life a lot; about stupid kids who throw trash all over the place, about metaphor of us longing for billboards on sunny days to provide us with shade, about how Fugazi, a band who is clearly revolutionary and far more important than anything I've ever done, even THEY sell records. I wrote a real sad song when I came home. Then I went to the Apple Store to meet someone and started playing the beginning of this song while waiting.

The next morning I found out that a close family friend, and an aunt of one of my close friends had died of cancer. I also found out later on that a friend's dad had died, and even later than that drummer of Premarital Sax, Zach Insler (sic, i'm sorry zach.) At funerals, I can't cry and I always feel terrible about it but at my family friend's funeral not only did I feel terrible about that but I felt terrible that I thought about floating out into the ocean the day before, and THEN i felt terrible about feeling terrible... FUCK, YO. I eventually wrote this whole song in my head at the funeral. The important thing to think about I guess is that everyone dies eventually, there's no sense in purposely speeding up or halting that process... but death is still terrible. This goes out to Lauren Connolly, Jason Bennett, Zach Insler, Mr. & Mrs. Jestrebzski, Bette Massari and Julie Possenreide's father and of course everyone else who has been bumming about their absence.

We're mad.\nWe're all mad at someone and our anger takes over\nAnd we stop having fun\nAnd we talk but don't act\nAnd then nothing will change.\nWe're so hellbent on destruction we forgot how to create.\n\nYou can't solve anything just by saying someone's wrong.\nYeah, behind your back we're enemies, face to face we get along.\n'Cause we still shop at Wal-Mart and they still get major deals\nAnd those insurance companies benefit from every fucking thing we steal.\n\nWe're not gonna fight and nothing's gonna change.\nIf we're not gonna fight, we're just lazy.\n\nI guess I think the thing we need to keep in mind this time\nIs that no one died the last time we stood up for our beliefs.\nSo I gotta say \"adios\" to irony.\n\"Later\" lethargy.\n\"So long\" sarcasm.\nWe're fucking bored with you.\nIf you want a war, we'll go to war with YOU.\n\nSo let's stop talking shit and let's start talking food.\nIf we're all feeling gyped, let's create something new.\n",
        "explanation": "This is in the same vein, but this is about people who ONLY talk about politics instead of actually doing anything about it. The fact is that since the internet, it's super easy to organize protests or to get together with people who feel the same as you that you can actually meet in person. Most importantly, however, this song is about personal relationships and passive-agressiveness. If you have a problem with someone, you're never gonna solve anything unless you actually talk it out, and in some situations fight. Because at the end of the day, shit's still gonna go wrong but if you give it a shot, at least it ain't your fault. The music for this song pretty much happened immediately as I was trying to play \"Coma Girl\" and played the wrong chord.",

I was really surprised to find out I wasn't dead or sick in the morning, and for the first time in a while I really appreciated life - and then got a tattoo of this rapper named Cecil Otter, who is part of the Minneapolis Doomtree crew. He drew it and it looks really good. I had only met him once, and I heard his music zero times. It's also about those people who are always talking about the sliver lining of whatever situation.

    "description": "\"Get Warmer\" by Bomb the Music Industry!, released in 2007, is a dynamic and emotionally charged album that solidifies the band's reputation for pushing the boundaries of punk rock. Jeff Rosenstock's poignant songwriting takes center stage as the album navigates themes of existential angst, societal disillusionment, and personal growth. With its eclectic mix of punk, ska, and indie rock influences, \"Get Warmer\" offers a cathartic listening experience that resonates with listeners grappling with the complexities of modern life. Rosenstock's raw vocals, coupled with the band's energetic instrumentation and cleverly crafted lyrics, create a sense of urgency and authenticity that defines the album. \"Get Warmer\" stands as a testament to Bomb the Music Industry!'s unwavering commitment to artistic freedom and innovation within the punk genre, leaving an indelible mark on the alternative music landscape.",
    "explanation": "This record was written over the period of six months in Athens, Georgia. There's a lot of firsts in this one: it's the first time a record has been solely based around a specific story arc in one location, it's the first time we've used live drums for a whole record, it's the first time a record has been demo'd and then re-recorded, it's the first time we used NO programmed synthesizers (all parts were played live, mostly analog) and it's also the first time anyone else has been involved with the recording process: mainly Joel Hatstat working the long long hot hot days of Bomb recording with me.\n\nThe recording process for a lot of these songs I think was fuuuun and I'll go into a little more detail about below. However, something that I tried really hard to do on this one was keep things extremely specific (songs about moving into new houses, washing dishes, riding bikes) but at the same time ATTEMPTING to use those specific situations to express huge life issues and emotional distresses. This record for me is a lot about escapism, depression, addiction, social, physical and financial problems but ultimately I think it's about positivity. I'm pretty sure people other than me take little shit, read into it and have that shape the way they view the world. This record is about accepting that and at least not reading too much into THAT problem.\n\nWe recorded this album in chronological order, labeled \"Bomb 1\" through \"Bomb 11.\" When we stepped into the studio and got drums EQ'd, set up and everything, Brady picked up drumsticks and played Bomb 1 perfect on his first try. We were all confused and said \"uh... you wanna do another take?\" to which he said \"uh... yeah, sure, why not?\" His next take was also perfect so we were like \"uh... we think that was right on? what do you think?\" and he said \"yeah... i think it was too?\" This set the tone for the drum sessions; Brady went on to record twelve songs in five hours, many first takes. After all of which we said \"yeah? alright! next!\"\n\nWe tracked the drums, key bass, piano, organ and wurlitzer at the Bakery in Athens, GA which was a bonafide REAL recording studio. It was fun to have a room with a bunch of cool stuff I've never seen before that we could use on the record. The \"Kee Bass\" in Bomb 2 was a one note pure booty bass synthesizer that looked kinda like an accordion. Andy Baker even let us taken out one of the analog Moogs to record on our own.\n\nMOST of the record was tracked at the Goblin Campground which was immediately renamed the Sweat Zone once the intense heat of May in Georgia crept up on us. The GC/SZ was an air-condition free art/warehouse space where Joel had been recording bands. We had been moving at a comfortable pace through April, planning on getting the album released in July by ourselves, however in April we got a call from Asian Man letting us know that they'd be into releasing the CD/vinyl and that our cutoff date would be May 31st if we wanted it out by the original time. After several text messages between Joel and I (including \"fuck it\" \"why not\" \"yeah\" \"no sweat\" and \"timelord is on your side\") we started REALLY digging in in May.\n\nJoel and I both had food service jobs (Joel a cook, me a dishwasher), girlfriends and scrabble addictions so every day in May was very very very long: it would usually start out with a game of scrabble at the coffee shop (why would we want to start early?) or joel cooking in the morning, setting up the computer, recording and mixing in a 100-degree-plus warehouse, working 'til 1 or 2 am, having about ten minutes for girlfriend time and then back into it the next morning. When Joel would work at night, I would record at my house. When I would work at night, Joel would mix. The final mixing, recording and mastering took place IMMEDIATELY before we left for a month-long tour in June; I was actually at Chase Park Transduction as Chotto Ghetto was picking up the keg for our tour kickoff show (which was, oddly enough, at the Sweat Zone.)\n\nThe FUN part of the record started when Rick Johnson called me up and asked me if he could play bass on the record. I said yes of course, but Rick eventually realized he wouldn't be able to get to Athens to record in time. Once he started recording at his house in Michigan, we realized \"fuck it. let's see if everyone wants to do this!\" Sean McCabe got John and Mike (both ex-ASOBers and current Bombers) to record his trombone and mandolin in various bedrooms and bathrooms and Neil Callaghan recorded stuff in his log cabin in the wilderness that I guess still had high speed internet. We also tried to get everyone we could in Athens in on it; all of We Versus the Shark, friends from Cinemechanica, Subversivo and Garbage Island, friends n girlfriends and my personal favorite Ben from the bike shop next door from the studio (myspace.com/bens_bikes). So it was like a big party that no one really wants to go to, but once you look back on it, it really WAS a fun party!\n",

And the payments stay the same no matter where you move and no matter how cheap the rent.\n\nStop screaming for a change.\nStart screaming for a wage.\n\nAnd the irony of plastic is when it starts replacing cash, soon enough you have no cash and it gets replaced with debt and all you're left with is past mistakes and the envelopes change color: all dimly lit pastels, they go white, then yellow then pink. It's like a fucking party to celebrate that you're fucked.\n\n\nElectric flow and dirty clothes and students loans, oh god, ya gotta pay 'em.\nElectric flow and student loans and dirty clothes, oh god, ya gotta clean 'em.\n\nWhile you can't get a decent wage, I still can't find a job. Yeah, my life just repeats the 2005 series of rejected applications and me botching interviews and waiting for phone calls from a temp agency that never calls at all. It's never easy it's always electric flow...\n\nThe attack, I'm feeling the attack, I'm feeling the attack\nof basic social skills I know I know I know I know I lack\nI'm hyper-cognizant of facts\nI'm well aware that we are barely scraping by\nMy good intentions aren't enough to salvage that\nGimme 1 gimme 2 gimme 3 4 5\nGimme more per hour so I can afford to pay for food and gas\nAnd bags to throw away the trash\nYa gotta throw away the trash.\n\nIt's hard to pay the bills whne you can't work a forty hour week.\nIt's hard to interview when I am too depressed to even speak.\nIt's hard to have a blast when we spend all our spare time feeling weak because we're thinking about that electric flow etc.\n",

    "description": "\"Scrambles\" by Bomb the Music Industry!, released in 2009, is a vibrant and eclectic album that showcases Jeff Rosenstock's boundless creativity and genre-defying approach to punk rock. This release sees the band experimenting with a diverse range of musical styles, from punk and ska to indie rock and electronic elements, creating a dynamic and unpredictable sonic journey. Lyrically, the album explores themes of personal struggles, existential crises, and the complexities of human relationships with a blend of wit, introspection, and raw emotion. With its energetic performances, catchy melodies, and inventive production techniques, \"Scrambles\" stands as a testament to Bomb the Music Industry!'s willingness to push the boundaries of punk music while maintaining their signature DIY ethos and irreverent spirit.",
    "explanation": "Fall 2008: I wanted to record an album that cost $50. Truthfully, we never spent that much money on a record before, but that's just because Joel recorded us pretty cheap on the last one. This time, I wanted to go at it without any help. I horned in on Halo Fauna/Get Bent/Red and Blue's practice space in Ridgewood, Queens, and prepared to record every day until the record sounded very very big. There were some problems however. Like the fact that the gate to the practice space would often roll back over the door so the alarm would go off and the door wouldn't open so you couldn't stop it. Or like the fact that someone in the space has been practicing to the same Marnie Stern song every Friday at 2 PM for the past three months. Or of course, what anyone who has ever recorded in a practice space knows, bad metal bands.\n\nSo the recording process went like this: Tom set up some mic's at Turnpike Sounds, a nice little studio that Brad Cordaro runs out of a basement in Huntington, Long Island. He recorded Mike's drums with a little bit of help from Brad and a littler bit of help from me. Shortly after that we set some stuff up in John's mom's basement and recorded bass guitars. From there on out it was a lot of days spent in a tiny, sweaty practice space with microphones sticking out of toilet paper rolls, laying down a bunch of stuff, occasionally recording some stuff at my apartment too. Tom recorded his guitar parts himself in his basement in Seaford. We were supposed to have our record finished before our fall tour, but since we didn't that allowed us some time to record a beautiful grand piano and a kinda beautiful wurlitzer at the Bakery (which happened to be where we were staying) in Georgia. I eventually went back to record a Pegasuses record and threw some analog synth on there. Shit, Joel Hatstat even played some sleigh bells. To top all that off, Rick and Chris recorded some parts in their respective states and Sean Bonnette recorded some sweet vocals with jalipaz at audioconfusion in Phoenix. And the icing on the cake! Kepi Ghoulie and Dino happened to be in town towards the end of the recording and got a chance to stop by the apartment and since into panty house draped around a wire hanger.\n\nOnce most of this stuff was down, Tom made a rough mix of one of the jams, feeling out some sweet EQ and compression settings. I sent a copy to Rick Johnson and he brought some reverb into it, which is something I've never put on Bomb recordings. Weird! After that I sat in my apartment for about three weeks straight, tweaking it and sending it over to Joel who would eventually master it. Finally when the record was almost done, we got some friends over my apartment in Brooklyn and John's mom's house in Baldwin to sing some gang vocals. We ate a lot of pizza in Brooklyn.\n\nThe point being that this record could not have been made as cheap without such good friends giving such good advice and sharing their such good time. It is possible to make a sweet record that you love for almost no money, but it's a lot more possible with pals. Over the past few years I've learned a lot from the buddies that we've spent time with, whether on tour or otherwise, and I asked some of them to share some things they may have learned from their experiences. Their responses are listed in the 'zine that comes with this record. Remember, doing things yourself is fun and usually cheaper! Cooking beats McDonalds! Fixing shit beats paying some asshole to fix it! Recording yourself gives you more time to explore! So quit scramblin' to fit into a failing system, GO OWN YOUR LIFE!!!!\n",

        "explanation": "This song was written in the kitchen of a house in Shreveport, Louisiana while on tour with Pegasuses-XL. There was a good chance it was going to end up being a longer song with more verses and a vibraphone solo, but I figured it would be more fun to try and build the song up instead of out. And that's the way I justify recording a subway tunnel on my blackberry and reversing prepared piano. I also realize now that if I thought transit delays and fare hikes were annoying before the big economy crash of 2008, the future is potentially gonna bum me out. Oh well, fuck it. I'm sure hipster-hating hipsters will always be equally as annoying.",

I guess this new fare hike means that I'll ride my bike, play video games and do other stuff that I like.\n\nAnd in the morning cleaning up, we found these plastic bags with a little bit of party left and started to laugh, “Man, I'm glad I passed out from the booze and the weed 'cause the house stayed up 'til 6 AM doing speed.” But now it's 1 AM and I'm quite a few in and I can barely make out where the bathroom line begins and it's been moving five inches every fucking five minutes.\n\nI wanna ask the over privileged kids if they would fucking mind? I gotta take a piss in the cocaine room. What is this? The line for lines? It's a long line for lines. I'm getting claustrophobia from the twenty-something set with bleary eyes. I don't wanna be part of this Friday night or Saturday night. I don't wanna be part of this line for lines, long line for lines. I don't wanna be part of this night.\n\nWhen I'm out these days I do is complain about the booming bass and the shitty DJ because if I wanted to go to a dance club, I'd own a bottle of Brut, a closet full of Christian Dior, and I'd be in a different room. 'Cause we can dance to Otis Redding, P.O.S, and M.I.A and if you're on Serato Scratch don't call yourself a DJ. Beat detecting's got no attitude, your tempo maps can't feel and room, but lemmings all have dancing shoes and I'm just freaking out.\n\nYou're assaulting me with thrusts like I'm an asshole. You're sweating to the sounds of Billboard's Hot 100 like a total yeah bro dick. Man, I thought that we all lived here 'cause we're different I guess I was wrong this time, and time after time I don't wanna be part of this Friday night or Saturday night. I don't wanna be part of these cokey times and eight dollar wines. I don't wanna be part of this night.\n\nThe city subway station never glistens. The gates rise up like “What's up? You're in prison, confined by alcoholism and lack of better decisions for having fun on the weekends.” But this shitty atmosphere keeps bumming me out. Don't want my Club MTV. I hate Downtown Julie Brown. I guess these new prices hikes will make me grab my light and climb the fire escape to the roof for a book that I like.\n",
        "explanation": "Shredding! I (now not so) secretly really wanted this song to be in Rock Band or Guitar Hero after I wrote it. I even emailed Asian Man Records about it! I think it probably is gonna be harder due to the use of the phrase \"fucking cocaine party fucking\" and also the Scott Weiland dissing. That's like a double whammy in rock and roll world. Anyway, you ever have cool friends bring you out to a bar that ends up being a dance club? Come on, buddies! Also, it's important that you know Matt Kurz came up with the genius idea to ask \"do you mind if I take a shit in the cocaine room?\" at a shady dive bar around the block from the houses where we both grew up so I stole that from him.",

The older I get the more questionable decisions I see my friends and myself making in order to fit into the great societal plan of get a job, make some babies, die happy. Although I know there is more to life than that, I constantly fear that I'm racing around to figure out what it is and if I don't I'm just gonna be a lonely poor corpse.",

        "lyrics": "There's nothing less cool than feeling exhausted from hours of not doing a damn thing at all. Not thrilling to chill, steal bandwidth and cable, give shouts to employers and wait for the call. There's a light shining out from the windowsill not content to project all day long. Maybe I could walk a little to the library. Closed. Maybe I could do this right for once.\n\nGet my ducks in a row and just stop talking trash or whatever they say. Make the bed, sweep the floor, shake the carpet and spray. Put my shit in a pile, on the top slap a post-it, “Don't worry, someday your skill set will be wanted.” But today everybody is a little tired, it's Wednesday. So at 10:00 I'm walking down a chilly Boerum to Broadway.\n\nAnd it's you and me and a tallboy of Colt 45 or Bud Light. What's the cheapest one? Get through one more night. I drink fast, I don't savor. Each way takes an hour and at twelve, I'll be gone.\n",
        "explanation": "When you're unemployed, it's tough to convince your pals to drink beers with you on a Wednesday night and it's also tough to hang out at a reasonable time when you're depending on the G train.

        "lyrics": "I walked two miles in the rain in a suit, my feet torn up by my father's shoes. Receipts and cards tumble out of my pocket to the floor of the station. I still don't have a wallet. Up a flight of stairs to Herald Square. The umbrellas of New York take up too much air. So we just walk real slow at double-arms length in unison.\n\nMy mom dragged me to the doctor today, I had a cough for a month and it won't go away 'cause I've been sleeping on floors for three hours a day and I have no insurance, so she has to pay. I can't talk to my friends because I'm embarrassed that I keep sliding back down. I keep getting depressed.\n\n- We got our ideals but no way to achieve them.\n- We got our degree but got no means to use it.\n- We're swimming in debt with no way to surmount it.\n- We got thirty bucks and we spend it on whiskey.\n- We got credit cards, so we got a new TV.\n- We got mobile phones but no minutes so text me.\n\nGet out of my way because I'm 25 and I still act like I'm ten! I'm 25! I don't learn from my mistakes I make them again and again and again and again and again...\n\n- We swallow our pride over piles of problems.\n- We whine and complain but we don't try to solve 'em.\n- We're reaching for answers like nobody's got 'em.\n\nGet out of my way because I'm 25 and I still act like I'm ten goddamn years old!\n",
        "explanation": "25 is a really tough birthday, I think. It's pretty much the year when you should be an adult and have your shit together, you're not a teenager or a college-age kid anymore even though days and minutes before you turn 25 dumb mistakes feel more excusable. I guess when you're twenty-five years old, you live with your parents, your mother pays for doctors visits and you make your money by walking dogs and pushing soda carts, it's hard to feel very good as a bona fide adult.",

We're all piss poor heroes, we're aching to drown in a sea of bad metaphors: trite, overused. Well, I'm sorry I guess talking just makes me confused. Dang dang.\n\nAnd as a result, conversations don't start, they sputter and stammer. They spiral like shit trying to go down the drain but keeps spinning 'cause forces are making it stay and I don't wanna talk 'cause you don't understand. This wasn't for anyone, I just wanted something that wasn't prepackaged, that wasn't preplanned and now my only plan that is damn sure to happen Is slowly decaying on a shelf filled with millionaires saving the future in a sweet fucking press release, gloating on pedestals. You can't make a change unless you're there bragging, unless you're a dick about something that's pure to you. Something that's pure to you always gets fucked.\n\n“Google my name, 'cause kid, I've got credentials. My pop's a big shit and I can get you free long distance. My co-op is awesome, my fixed gear's ridiculous. Stop smiling, stop frowning, I always thought you'd be different.”\n\nAnd there's been talk of leaving for good, but how and to where and what happens when they show up there with friends? Can you afford to leave again?\n",

When you put us on last and late, assholes, we're getting paid.\n\nWe didn't bring the shitty attitude but our kids still came and yo, I heard that friends and bands and human beings are supposed to help each other out, okay?\nEven twenty bucks could have fixed this up. A gesture. SOMETHING. We'll feel super posi when there's sugar in your gas tank, stink bombs at your CMJ convention. No one bought your record. Oh no!

Or how about some amateur footage of southern Virginians crying to the camera and shopping at Rite-Aid buying flags to translate what they gotta prove on this year's anniversary. We're mourning the loss, oh what can ya do but make the evening news logo red white and blue!

But when we all march to the beat of the same different drummer, the steps start to come off like clockwork. I guess I'm saying we could stand to be nicer because when you're in a basement talking shit and interspersing it with speaking in namedrops and units, I must admit I'm not the best when on the defensive. I'd rather steal your whiskey than your heart in conversation. I'd rather break three strings a song then stick to a routine like I'm ripe for the picking after growing on a tree and then talk about the industry, cross-market positivity with vinyl nerds and brightly colored, quirky messy record sleeves. I'd rather be vomiting and I despise vomiting. Blugh.\n\nBut thanks for the beer. I appreciate your time but can we talk about something else? If you really think that you and I are on the same page you can go ahead and fuck yourself. Because you've got coke and good looks, I've got overdue library books so let's be friends and change the subject now.\n\n'Cause the last thing I wanna be is another negative asshole. Like God speaks through my acoustic guitar and I've got the perfect set of morals on a dry erase board at the front of the house.\n\nFOLLOW THESE CONDITIONS OR WE'LL KICK YOUR ASS OUT:\nVegans only: NO MEAT ALLOWED!\nStraight edge only: NO DRINKING ALLOWED!\nFixed gears only: NO THREE-SPEEDS ALLOWED!\nMe me me!!!: I'M SMART! I'M RIGHT! I'M SMART!\n\nI think it's dumb when you take the inherently fun like riding bikes and singing songs and say they're not for everyone as if for your whole life you were cool as shit.\n\n“Punk tourist!”\n'Cause you still beg for cash cause you spent your parents' last on a Greyhound to the Fest and your jacket says Crass but I don't give an ass I'm not giving you fifty cents so that you can buy a forty and destroy a hotel party as the man who shrugs your mess up shrugs and says, “This non-conformity looks like conformity, like boring nice people pose threats to your authority. This positivity is negativity and you boys sure left me with a mess to clean.”\n\nSmile big, hug bigger. Talk big, act bigger. Stop judging do something, shut the fuck up do something. Instead of sneering at my friends and me 'cause we're not stealing buy a troubled friend a drink at the bar and tip well. Don't spend your time scoffing when do that you're just scoffing like the people who scoff at us while defending our community. You're a teacher, you're a parent, you're the head of a dictatorship. When the ground is covered up in rules you're guaranteed to power trip.\n\nThis non-conformity looks like conformity. Why should anyone believe in our community? This organization doesn't feel like anarchy 'cause we're suiting up to have the same identity and the boring nice people say, “Shut up the punx!” All the people who have barbecues to feed their friends and family, “Shut up the punx!” All the people writing zines with information, not just blaming things, “Shut up the punx!” All the boys and girls are fed up with just saying that we're punk, we say, “Shut up the punx!”\n",

It's disheartening however when the small few seem to think acting high and mighty about their politics (or worse, doing so in an effort to eventually cash in) is going to help anyone or change anything. But fuck that. This is a love letter to the active people in the punk rock community who make the world a better place for all us outcasts.",

I know that six weeks was kind of a bit much and that nothing is forever, and that nothing should be. Someday it all stops and I can't sleep now because I'm not a real fucking adult but I guess now I'll have my life from 7 to 6:45. Marie! Marie! Marie! I'm sorry I've been too busy for the promise of an unfulfilling life.\n\nThe risks I took were mine to take. We couldn't communicate in anything but rote responses and shit eating grins. Everything starts dwindling when it's all built on power trips and pandering. The letter arrived yesterday. I didn't have a drop to drink. I had to play and drive four hours to Brooklyn to my apartment of dirty shit and 1,000 lonely days ahead.\n\nBut I guess now I'll have my life with red and black out of my eyes. Marie! Marie! Marie! I'm really stoked you set me free from the promise of an unfulfilling life where I can pay my bills and pass out at eleven and not wake up in the morning and start feeling bad. Worst case of the mondays that I've ever had though I treat every weekday like a Saturday night except for drinks I can't afford. A can of Shmidty's, nothing more. I/you/we all need some more security than that provided by choosing between a job you hate, a job you hate and a job that doesn't pay. I got too caught up with me to behave responsibly. Michael, Nathan and Christine, I've got no rent, Marie! Marie!\n\nI was arguing with cops while I had a fake moustache on, poorly handling emotions, swimming naked in the ocean,breaking bottles all over your floor and leaving without our passports, drinking gin and Zicam until 2 AM while playing rock band, inviting myself into homes of strangers to drink all alone, leaving sweat-soaked boxers on a bar 'cause they said “put a t-shirt on,” acting irresponsibly and trying to make a choice between a job you hate and a job that doesn't pay.\n",
        "explanation": "When you go on tour long enough, a lot of things in your home life suffer. Everyone in a band has probably lost a job (or will lose one) from focusing too much on what they love. I thought that getting a letter from human resources in the mail on the last day of tour was a particularly cold way to be discharged from a job that I had for years, but maybe it was just an indicator that it was time to move on in my life.",

I demoed this one in Attractive and Popular's house in Arkansas, but I may have pissed them off because before I did that I drank a bottle of whiskey, snubbed the singer of the Blue Meanies, maybe started crying and made everyone turn off Last Action Hero. Then again, the next morning I felt okay, they took us to an amazing breakfast and the hot springs where we grabbed pennies out of the bottom of the boiling water.

    "description": "\"ADULTS!!!: SMART!!! SHITHAMMERED!!! AND EXCITED BY NOTHING!!!!!!!\" by Bomb the Music Industry!, released in 2010, is a bold and eclectic album that captures the disillusionment and absurdity of modern adult life. Jeff Rosenstock's songwriting shines as the album delves into themes of existential crises, societal pressures, and the struggles of navigating adulthood in a chaotic world. With its frenetic energy, witty lyricism, and genre-blurring sound that incorporates elements of punk, ska, and indie rock, the album offers a cathartic and thought-provoking listening experience. Rosenstock's impassioned vocals, backed by the band's dynamic instrumentation, create a sense of urgency and authenticity that resonates with listeners grappling with the complexities of growing up and finding meaning in an increasingly nonsensical world. \"ADULTS!!!\" stands as a testament to Bomb the Music Industry!'s ability to confront societal norms and challenge conventions while maintaining their irreverent and DIY spirit.",

    "description": "\"I Look Like Shit\" by Jeff Rosenstock, released in 2012, is a raw and introspective album that captures the essence of personal struggle and self-reflection. Rosenstock's emotionally charged vocals and raw lyricism shine through in tracks like \"Twinkle,\" \"Snow Charges,\" and \"Bonus Oceans,\" which explore themes of anxiety, disillusionment, and the complexities of navigating adulthood. The album's lo-fi production adds to its intimate and unfiltered quality, allowing listeners to connect deeply with Rosenstock's vulnerability and authenticity. With its blend of punk rock, indie sensibilities, and confessional songwriting, \"I Look Like Shit\" stands as a testament to Rosenstock's ability to craft compelling narratives and evoke powerful emotions, making it a standout addition to his discography.\n",
    "explanation": "Okay, so here's the deal. There's a lot of songs here. A handful of them were demos for a Bomb the Music Industry! EP called I Always Dread The End Of Summer, but shit got busy and that didn't end up happening. And then a bunch of them was for a slower record I was working on called I'm Serious, I'm Sorry, but it wasn't really coming together terribly fast and who the hell knows if that'll ever happen. However, I do know that if leave a bunch of food on your kitchen counter for too long, that shit is gonna get moldy, start attracting flies and smell like shit. So instead of having these jams just sit around doing nothing, here they all are along with some more new songs and some covers in full noisy drum machine shitty vocals glory.\n\nThe majority of this record is about fear and death. These songs are pretty much not about good times, but I actually love good times. I have a lot of really wonderful friends all over who make life worth living, and I am super lucky to have 'em. Fuck yeah! Thanks guys!!!\n\nA special thanks to Ian Graham and Matt Keegan for always listening to my demos and encouraging me, to Laura Stevenson, Mike Campbell and JT Turret for convincing me that it's okay to release songs with lyrics that I may think are too dark and reminding me that those are actually the only lyrics I ever want to listen to, and of course a double plus extra thanks to Christine for puttin' up with the ruckus.\n\nOh yeah, and thanks Bob for the translation!!!\n",

Fake snore. None the wiser.\n\nVictoria made me happy\nNow I can only be scared\nAnd people tell me that time can fix the wound.\nBut that's crap.\n'Cause she's not coming back\nAnd life's unfair.\n\nI'm always anxious and worried.\nI'm always freaked out and scared.\nAnd people tell me that time can fix the wound.\nBut that's crap.\nVicki's not coming back.\n\nAnd I scream, \"Why did I get left behind?\"\nI know it's an exaggeration\nto say I would rather die than\nshare this place with people capable\nof inspiring such fear and hopelessness\nthat I'm frozen in my bed...\nbut that sums it up.\n\nTeenage halloween\nHot safety pins in nozzles of shaving cream\nSpend the evening spraying cars, toilet papering houses\nWhat's the harm in smashing pumpkins?\n\nDecades on, with kids\nAnd I don't let them go out past dark.\nI sit on the front porch with a shotgun\nWhile they're upstairs sleeping.\nTotal darkness.\nLove.

This is the first record I've made with a band since Bomb the Music Industry! We recorded with Jack Shirley and we tried to make pop songs that got real weird and gross. This is a split release with SideOneDummy - they were cool enough to let me put this up for free, so if you like it please consider purchasing a record, donating or if you're broke just share it with some buddies. This music is here for you regardless of your income. Hope to see ya one day!!",

Rosenstock delivers a frenetic and explosive sonic experience across the album's 17 tracks, seamlessly blending elements of punk rock, indie pop, ska, and even electronic influences. From the anthemic opener \"We Begged 2 Explode\" to the introspective closer \"Perfect Sound Whatever,\" each song on \"Worry\" offers a rollercoaster ride of emotions and a candid reflection on life's complexities. Rosenstock's impassioned vocals and razor-sharp lyricism capture the zeitgeist of a generation grappling with existential dread and societal upheaval, making \"Worry\" not only a musical tour de force but also a deeply resonant and cathartic listening experience for anyone navigating the uncertainties of the modern age.",

        "lyrics": "I arrived drenched in morning light and it churned my guts unless I closed my eyes. Made it up the stairs to the bed inside without puking up a fantastic time. And everything so unexpectedly started to feel like a dream but I couldn't stop drifting out when the magic would spin.\n\n2:00 PM: I missed my class again. Did you miss yours too because you're sleeping in? Are the two of us both imagining seven-hour round-trips into each others' beds? And everything so unexpectedly started to feel like a dream but I was preoccupied with how the magic would end because nothing intangible remains sustainable. Hope is a scheme.\nWill I ever see you again and if I see you soon will you want to see me? Or will you just want to sneak away? Did I creep you out like a scary movie? I hope that we feel the same. I hope that we feel the same.\n\nFuck. Oh, I did something weird last night. I made out in the van with a girl I like. We were kinda drunk, but it seemed alright, so we made out for the entire ride and everything so unexpectedly started to feel like a dream... if I see you soon will you want to see me or will you just want to sneak away? Will you kiss me hard like a garbage movie? I hope that we feel the same.\n\nI hope I'm not reading into this too much, it's a kiss. But is there someone thinking of me when I'm feeling alone and I'm spending weekends staring at the wall. If there's someone thinking of you when you're feeling alone, how can that compare to nothing nice at all?\nAnd if I see you soon will you want to see me or will you just try to sneak away? Will you kiss me hard like some shit in a terrible movie? I hope that we feel the same.\n",

These are the Amazon days, we are the binge watching age and we'll be stuck in a screen until our phones fall asleep. I am never letting go of you.\n\nWe'll get lost and wander off distracted by fake news. When our towns fall to the ground it won't shatter me and you and when we're looking around at all the shit that went down 'cause half of us were too scared and half of us were too proud to see the systems we start are destined to fall apart when we let power and greed corrupt our collective heart, oh, I am never letting go of you.\n\nWe'll get lost and wander off enraptured by fake doom. When our towns fall to the ground, oh, it won't shatter me and you whenever we feel ashamed being alive and awake in such an era of hate and military police. These are the mass murder days. We are the blast damage age where we can't love anything because they keep us afraid, oh, I will be there kicking, fighting, beating, screaming, “There's no fucking way I'm ever letting go of you.”\n",

    "description": "\"POST-\" by Jeff Rosenstock, released in 2018, is a powerful and politically charged album that serves as a rallying cry for disillusioned and disaffected youth in the tumultuous political climate of the time. Rosenstock's trademark blend of punk rock energy, catchy melodies, and introspective lyricism shines through in tracks like \"USA\" and \"Yr Throat,\" which confront themes of societal injustice, political unrest, and the struggle for personal identity. The album's urgent and anthemic sound captures the zeitgeist of a generation grappling with uncertainty and frustration, offering both solace and a call to action. With its unapologetic commentary on contemporary issues and Rosenstock's impassioned delivery, \"POST-\" stands as a testament to the power of music as a vehicle for social change and collective catharsis.",
    "explanation": "Jeff Rosenstock was an anxious kid who grew into an anxious adult and has also made a bunch of music along the way with a bunch of bands, most notably Bomb the Music Industry! who apparently pioneered giving shit away for free on the internet - or at least got some of the credit for it. Now he plays with his bi-coastal band of rad musicians, mixing punk heart with diverse instrumentation and occasional accuracy.\n\nThe new record POST- was written in a snowy mountain dreamscape, recorded in a marathon session and finished moments before it was released on New Year's Day. Most of it (like totally 51% minimum) was recorded live to tape, making the record a fiery distillation of Rosenstock's high energy live shows that push the boundaries of dynamics in rock music.\n\nI hope. I don't know, that's what I was going for at least.\n",

    "description": "\"NO DREAM\" by Jeff Rosenstock, released in 2020, is a blistering and incisive reflection on the state of the world, capturing the anxieties, frustrations, and hopes of a generation facing unprecedented challenges. Rosenstock's signature blend of punk rock energy, anthemic hooks, and introspective lyricism shines through in tracks like \"Scram!\" and \"Nikes (Alt),\" which confront themes of political disillusionment, personal struggle, and the search for meaning in a chaotic world. With its relentless pace and raw emotion, the album serves as a rallying cry for solidarity and resilience in the face of adversity. Rosenstock's impassioned delivery and unflinching honesty make \"NO DREAM\" not only a powerful musical statement but also a visceral and cathartic listening experience for anyone grappling with the uncertainties of the present moment.",

She told us it's been rough and you deserved a break and marrying that guy, obviously was mistake - you had a couple kids but now he's always gone and you're stuck sweeping hair at your mommy's hair salon.\n\nThe flat you have upstairs, tucked in the suburbs safe, is running low on bread and other amenities 'cause your mom's been secretly renting your place.\n\nAl,\nYour elevator looked in hella disrepair but I'm not fuckin' with a dozen flights of stairs. I tenderized my legs somewhere in Germany trying to convince the bored to pay attention to me. The absinthe that we drank? I'm not sure it was real. Massage place in the building? We know what's the fuckin' deal 'cause fratboys wait outside, pretending their not there, avert their glassy eyes, but I don't really care.\n\nI don't wanna lay in bed and stare at the ceiling\nWhile chasing the fleeting\nThere's too much in my head to sleep\nAnd I did the thing that movie said,\n\"Foot on the floor beside the bed\"\nStill too much in my head to sleep tonight.\nGet fucked up, break your stupid bones again.\nGet fucked up, lose your telephone again.\nGet fucked up, bother all your friends again.\nGet fucked up, shame your broken heart again.\n\nI really gotta leave, but I just wanna stay. I'm only a real person for a quarter-dozen days until I gotta scram, until I go away and turn into a person that I didn't want to be - cultivating mold on my laundry and becoming so afraid I'm honestly placing bets on a chemical crapshoot with my brain.\nCleaning for the dealer so I'll black out on the plane.\nMumbling in the dark and living vicariously\nThrough a photo album in a stranger's BNB.\n",

    "description": "\"SKA DREAM,\" released by Jeff Rosenstock in 2020, is a unique and genre-bending album that presents a ska reinterpretation of the same songs featured in his critically acclaimed 2020 release, \"NO DREAM.\" This creative endeavor showcases Rosenstock's versatility and willingness to experiment with his own material. The album pays homage to his ska punk roots from The Arrogant Sons of Bitches days while injecting a fresh and spirited energy into each track. With its lively brass arrangements, catchy melodies, and Jeff's distinctive vocals, \"SKA DREAM\" stands out as a vibrant and entertaining reimagining of the original songs, offering fans a new perspective on familiar tunes within the realms of ska and punk.",
    "explanation": "The very good idea to make this record came together when, like many other bands throughout this pandemic that refused to participate in super spreading events, we were trying to find a fun way to make some music together to share with people. Otherwise we were just spending our evenings texting the group chat in dread about the collapsing world around us. Not the most fun band activity.\n\nAs with most things ska in my life, what started out as a fun goof with friends eventually morphed into “Hey, what if we tried to make it good though?” All of us have a pretty deep history playing and touring the country in punk/ska bands. We all understand the stigma that comes along with ska, we've all dealt with the pitfalls of it, and we've all kept on truckin' regardless. If you are one of those people who loves music as long as it isn't ska, that's cool, we see you. This record isn't for you and you don't have to listen to it. Byeeee. Okay, everyone else, we see you too, we love you and check it out, SKA DREAM is real.",

She told us it's been rough and you deserved a break and marrying that guy, obviously was mistake - you had a couple kids but now he's always gone and you're stuck sweeping hair at your mommy's hair salon.\n\nThe flat you have upstairs, tucked in the suburbs safe, is running low on bread and other amenities 'cause your mom's been secretly renting your place.\n\nDan,\nYour elevator looked in hella disrepair but I'm not fuckin' with a dozen flights of stairs. I tenderized my legs somewhere in Germany trying to convince the bored to pay attention to me. The absinthe that we drank? I'm not sure it was real. Massage place in the building? We know what's the fuckin' deal 'cause fratboys wait outside, pretending their not there, avert their glassy eyes, but I don't really care.\n\nI don't wanna lay in bed and stare at the ceiling\nWhile chasing the fleeting\nThere's too much in my head to sleep\nAnd I did the thing that movie said,\n“Foot on the floor beside the bed”\nStill too much in my head to sleep tonight.\nGet fucked up, break your stupid bones again.\nGet fucked up, lose your telephone again.\nGet fucked up, bother all your friends again.\nGet fucked up, shame your broken heart again.\n\nI really gotta leave, but I just wanna stay. I'm only a real person for a quarter-dozen days until I gotta scram, until I go away and turn into a person that I didn't want to be - cultivating mold on my laundry and becoming so afraid I'm honestly placing bets on a chemical crapshoot with my brain.\nCleaning for the dealer so I'll black out on the plane.\nMumbling in the dark and living vicariously\nThrough a photo album in a stranger's BNB.\n",
