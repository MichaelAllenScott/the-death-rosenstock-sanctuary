    "description": "The Arrogant Sons of Bitches was a ska-punk band that emerged from Long Island, New York, in the late 1990s. The band was founded by musician Jeff Rosenstock in 1995 as a solo project during his high school years. The project soon evolved into a full-fledged band, drawing influences from ska, punk, and other genres. With a distinctive blend of energetic ska rhythms, punk rock sensibilities, and socially conscious lyrics, they quickly gained a loyal local following.\n\nThroughout their active years, spanning from the late 1990s to the mid-2000s, The Arrogant Sons of Bitches released several albums, EPs, and singles. Their music was characterized by its catchy melodies, energetic performances, and thought-provoking lyrics that often touched on themes of political awareness, personal struggles, and social commentary. The band's lineup underwent changes over the years, but their music consistently retained its fervent spirit and creative edge.\n\nWhile not achieving mainstream commercial success, The Arrogant Sons of Bitches left a lasting impact on the ska-punk and DIY music scenes. They are remembered for their passionate live shows and their contribution to the underground punk community. Furthermore, the band's founder, Jeff Rosenstock, went on to establish a successful solo career and formed the band \"Bomb the Music Industry!\" which also made waves in the punk and indie scenes. The Arrogant Sons of Bitches' legacy lives on through their influence on subsequent generations of musicians who continue to draw inspiration from their genre-blending sound and unapologetic approach to music and activism.",
